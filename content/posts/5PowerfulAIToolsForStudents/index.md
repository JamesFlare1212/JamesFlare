## Introduction

I got shocked by how fast the AI Tools been developed these days. I believe that students like you and me should at least get some ideas about how this world going on.

As a student, our tasks are clear and sample. We take lessons, make notes, and be prepared for exams.

So, we got the idea about what we need:

- Text Book Reading
- Note Making
- Reviewing
- Past Paper Practice
- Getting Feedback

## Text Book Reading

Before the lessons, we should read the textbook, this is called pre-view.
