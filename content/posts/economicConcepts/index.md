There are **389** terms with Definition, Explanation and Example.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Abatement
- Definition: A reduction or decrease in something, often used in the context of taxes and environmental regulations.
- Explanation: Abatement refers to a reduction in the amount or intensity of something. In the context of taxes, it often refers to a reduction in the amount of tax owed. In the context of environmental regulations, it refers to a reduction in pollution or other negative impacts on the environment.
- Example: A city might offer a tax abatement to a company that agrees to move its headquarters there and create jobs.

## Absolute advantage
- Definition: The ability of one country, company, or individual to produce a good or service more efficiently than another, using the same amount of resources.
- Explanation: Absolute advantage is a concept in economics that compares the productivity of two entities in producing a particular good or service. It occurs when one entity can produce the good or service using fewer resources (such as time, labor, or raw materials) than the other entity.
- Example: If a farmer can grow 10 bushels of wheat per hour while another farmer can only grow 8 bushels of wheat per hour, the first farmer has an absolute advantage in wheat production.

## Accelerator
- Definition: An economic theory that explains how changes in investment can trigger fluctuations in aggregate demand and output levels.
- Explanation: The accelerator theory suggests that changes in investment levels can lead to corresponding changes in overall economic output. When businesses invest in new equipment or technology, for example, they may need to hire additional workers or purchase more supplies, which in turn can stimulate economic growth.
- Example: During a recession, the government may implement policies designed to encourage businesses to invest more in order to stimulate economic growth.

## Accounting profit
- Definition: The difference between total revenue and explicit costs (such as wages, rent, utilities) incurred in operating a business over a specific period of time.
- Explanation: Accounting profit is a measure of a company's profitability that takes into account only explicit costs, such as wages, rent, and utilities. It does not consider implicit costs, such as the opportunity cost of using capital or the value of unpaid labor.
- Example: If a bakery earns $100,000 in revenue during a year but incurs $70,000 in explicit costs such as wages and rent, its accounting profit would be $30,000.

## Ad valorem tax
- Definition: A tax that is levied as a percentage of the value of a good or service.
- Explanation: Ad valorem taxes are based on the value of the item being taxed, rather than on some other measure such as weight or quantity. They are commonly used for items such as real estate or luxury goods, where the value of the item is directly related to its price.
- Example: A sales tax that is equal to 5% of the purchase price of a car is an example of an ad valorem tax.

## Adverse selection
- Definition: Adverse selection is a situation where one party in a transaction has better information than the other, which leads to an imbalance of information and potentially negative outcomes.
- Explanation: Adverse selection occurs when there is an asymmetry of information between buyers and sellers. In such a situation, the more informed party can take advantage of the less informed party by offering products or services that are of lower quality than expected or charging higher prices for them.
- Example: An example of adverse selection is when a used car dealer sells a car to a customer without disclosing known defects, taking advantage of the customer's lack of knowledge about the car's condition.

## Aggregate demand
- Definition: Aggregate demand represents the total amount of goods and services that consumers, businesses, and the government want to buy at a particular price level and period of time.
- Explanation: Aggregate demand is influenced by factors such as consumer confidence, disposable income, interest rates, and government spending. It is typically downward sloping because as prices increase, people tend to purchase fewer goods and services due to reduced purchasing power.
- Example: If the economy is experiencing a boom, consumer confidence may be high, leading to an increase in spending, which in turn drives up aggregate demand.

## Aggregate expenditure
- Definition: Aggregate expenditure refers to the total amount spent on goods and services in an economy over a specific period.
- Explanation: Aggregate expenditure is calculated by adding together consumption expenditure, investment expenditure, government expenditure, and net exports. It is a measure of the overall level of economic activity in an economy.
- Example: If the government increases its spending on infrastructure projects, this will increase aggregate expenditure, as more money is flowing into the economy.

## Aggregate supply
- Definition: Aggregate supply represents the total amount of goods and services that producers are willing and able to supply at a particular price level and period of time.
- Explanation: Aggregate supply is influenced by factors such as the cost of inputs, technology, and the availability of resources. It is typically upward sloping because as prices rise, producers have an incentive to produce more goods and services to earn higher profits.
- Example: If the price of crude oil rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to produce goods, leading to a decrease in aggregate supply.

## Allocative efficiency
- Definition: Allocative efficiency is achieved when resources are allocated in a way that maximizes social welfare, so that no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
- Explanation: Allocative efficiency requires that goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost and in quantities that reflect consumers' preferences. In this way, society achieves the greatest possible satisfaction from the use of available resources.
- Example: A firm achieves allocative efficiency if it produces goods that are highly valued by consumers, while keeping its production costs as low as possible.

## Antitrust laws
- Definition: Laws that aim to promote fair competition in the marketplace by prohibiting anti-competitive practices and promoting consumer welfare.
- Explanation: Antitrust laws are designed to prevent businesses from engaging in activities that reduce competition or create monopolies, which can harm consumers by limiting choice and raising prices. These laws may also encourage innovation and entrepreneurship by preventing large firms from stifling smaller competitors.
- Example: The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 is a well-known U.S. antitrust law that prohibits agreements that restrain trade and monopolization.

## Appreciation
- Definition: An increase in the value of an asset or currency relative to another.
- Explanation: Appreciation occurs when an asset or currency becomes more valuable due to factors such as increased demand, stronger economic growth, or higher interest rates. It is often used to describe changes in exchange rates, stock prices, or property values.
- Example: If the value of the Euro increases relative to the U.S. dollar, this would be an example of Euro appreciation.

## Arbitrage
- Definition: The practice of buying and selling assets or currencies in different markets to take advantage of price differences and make a profit with little or no risk.
- Explanation: Arbitrage opportunities arise when the same asset or currency is priced differently in different markets or exchanges. Traders can buy the asset where it is cheaper and sell it where it is more expensive, making a profit on the difference in price.
- Example: A trader might buy shares of a company that are trading at a lower price on one stock exchange and immediately sell them on another exchange where they are trading at a higher price.

## Asset
- Definition: Anything that has value and can be owned or controlled to produce positive economic value for its owner.
- Explanation: Assets can include physical items like property, inventory, or equipment, as well as financial instruments like stocks, bonds, or currency. They may be used to generate income, provide capital gains, or maintain liquidity.
- Example: Examples of assets include real estate, company stocks, bank deposits, and patents.

## Asset price bubble
- Definition: A situation in which the prices of certain assets rise rapidly and above their intrinsic value, leading to an eventual collapse or correction.
- Explanation: Asset price bubbles occur when investors become overly optimistic about the future value of an asset and continue to buy it despite its rising price. This creates a feedback loop where prices continue to rise until they become disconnected from the underlying fundamentals of the asset's value, leading to a sudden decline in prices.
- Example: The housing market bubble in the mid-2000s is an example of an asset price bubble, where high demand for housing led to rapidly rising prices that eventually collapsed.

## Asymmetric information
- Definition: Asymmetric information is a situation where one party in an economic transaction has more or better information than the other party.
- Explanation: This can lead to one party taking advantage of the other or making decisions that are not in the best interest of both parties. Asymmetric information can occur in various types of transactions, including financial markets, used car sales, and employment negotiations.
- Example: A used car seller may have more information about the car's history and condition than the buyer, leading to an unfair advantage for the seller.

## Autarky
- Definition: Autarky is a state of self-sufficiency or economic independence where a country or region produces all the goods and services it needs without relying on external trade.
- Explanation: In autarky, there is no international trade, and all production and consumption occur within the economy. It is rare for a modern economy to achieve complete autarky, as most countries engage in international trade to access resources, goods, and services they cannot produce domestically.
- Example: North Korea is often cited as an example of a country that attempts to maintain autarky by limiting its foreign trade and relying heavily on domestic production.

## Average cost
- Definition: Average cost (AC) is the total cost of producing a certain quantity of output divided by the quantity produced.
- Explanation: AC reflects the average cost of each unit of output and includes all the costs involved in production, such as materials, labor, and overhead. It is an important concept in economics as it influences pricing decisions and profit margins.
- Example: If a company spends $1000 to produce 100 units of a product, the average cost per unit would be $10 ($1000/100).

## Average product
- Definition: Average product (AP) is the total output produced by a given number of workers divided by the number of workers employed.
- Explanation: AP represents the productivity of each worker and is an indicator of how efficiently resources are being used in production. It is typically used to analyze short-term changes in productivity as the number of workers changes.
- Example: If a factory produces 1000 units with 10 workers, the average product would be 100 units per worker (1000/10).

## Average revenue
- Definition: Average revenue (AR) is the total revenue earned by a firm divided by the quantity of output sold.
- Explanation: AR reflects the average price of each unit of output and is an important metric for pricing decisions. It is different from marginal revenue (MR), which is the change in revenue resulting from selling one additional unit of output.
- Example: If a company earns $5000 by selling 100 units of a product, the average revenue per unit would be $50 ($5000/100).



## Backward-bending supply curve
- Definition: A backward-bending supply curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the quantity supplied of a good or service and its price, where the supply curve bends backwards beyond a certain point.
- Explanation: At low prices, suppliers are willing to increase their output as prices rise to make more money. However, beyond a certain point, suppliers may start to decrease their output in response to increases in price because they are already producing at maximum capacity or face diminishing returns or increasing costs.
- Example: An example of a backward-bending supply curve can be seen in the labor market where workers may work longer hours for higher wages up to a point but may reduce their working hours if wages become too high.

## Balance of payments
- Definition: The balance of payments is a record of all international transactions between residents of one country and the rest of the world during a particular period of time.
- Explanation: It includes all financial transactions such as trade in goods and services, investment income, and transfers between countries. The balance of payments is divided into two main accounts - the current account and the capital account.
- Example: If a country imports more goods than it exports, it will have a current account deficit. However, it can finance this deficit by attracting more foreign investment, resulting in a surplus on the capital account.

## Balance of trade
- Definition: The balance of trade is a component of the balance of payments that records the value of a country’s exports minus the value of its imports of goods and services during a specific period of time.
- Explanation: A positive balance of trade (surplus) occurs when a country exports more than it imports, while a negative balance of trade (deficit) occurs when a country imports more than it exports.
- Example: China has a significant trade surplus with the United States as it exports more goods to the US than it imports from the US.

## Balance sheet
- Definition: A balance sheet is a financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.
- Explanation: It provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position and helps investors and creditors understand how much the company owns (its assets), how much it owes (its liabilities), and what’s left over for shareholders (equity).
- Example: A company’s balance sheet might show that it has $500,000 worth of assets, including $300,000 in cash and $200,000 in inventory, $250,000 in liabilities, including $150,000 in loans and $100,000 in accounts payable, and $250,000 in equity. 

## Bank run
- Definition: A bank run is a situation where many depositors simultaneously withdraw their money from a bank due to concerns about the bank’s stability or solvency.
- Explanation: Bank runs can be triggered by rumors, news reports, or actual events that shake depositor confidence in the bank. Bank runs can lead to a bank’s failure if it does not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands of its depositors.
- Example: During the 2008 financial crisis, many banks experienced bank runs as depositors feared that their banks would fail.

## Bankruptcy
- Definition: Bankruptcy is a legal process that allows individuals or businesses who are unable to repay their debts to seek relief from some or all of their debt.

## Barriers to entry
- Definition: Barriers to entry refer to any obstacle that makes it difficult for new firms or companies to enter into a particular market or industry.
- Explanation: These barriers can be in the form of high startup costs, government regulation, patents, economies of scale, or brand recognition of existing competitors.
- Example: A pharmaceutical company investing millions of dollars in research and development to develop a new drug that can only be produced by them due to patent protection.

## Barter
- Definition: Barter is a system of exchange where goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using money as an intermediary.
- Explanation: In a barter system, individuals or businesses exchange their excess or unwanted goods or services with others who need them, eliminating the need for cash transactions.
- Example: Trading vegetables with fruits with a neighbor who is a farmer.

## Base year
- Definition: The base year is a reference point used in economic analysis to measure changes in certain economic variables over time.
- Explanation: An index or statistical measure is created based on the values of a specific base year. This measure is then used to track how those values change relative to the base year over time.
- Example: CPI (Consumer Price Index) uses a base year to calculate inflation rate percentage. 

## Behavioral economics
- Definition: Behavioral economics is a branch of economics that studies how psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural, and social factors influence the decision-making processes of individuals and organizations.
- Explanation: It seeks to explain why people make irrational decisions instead of making logical choices, which is the traditional approach of economics.
- Example: Behavioral economists study why consumers often spend more money on luxury items when they know they cannot afford them.

## Black market
- Definition: The black market refers to an underground or illegal market where goods or services are bought and sold without government regulation or oversight.
- Explanation: Black markets arise when transactions are prohibited or restricted by law, such as drugs, weapons, or human trafficking.
- Example: Purchasing counterfeit designer handbags from street vendors.

## Bond
- Definition: A bond is a debt security issued by a borrower, usually a corporation or government, to raise funds from investors.
- Explanation: Investors who buy bonds are lending money to the issuer in return for regular interest payments until the bond's maturity date, at which point they receive their initial investment back.
- Example: A company issues bonds to finance a new project, and investors buy these bonds, receiving coupon payments annually.

## Break-even point
- Definition: The break-even point is the level of sales at which total revenues equal total costs, resulting in neither a profit nor a loss.
- Explanation: It is the minimum amount of business activity required for a company to cover its expenses.
- Example: If a company has fixed costs of $100,000 per year and variable costs of $10 per unit, it needs to sell 10,000 units to break even (total revenue = $100,000 + 10,000 x $10).

## Budget constraint
- Definition: A budget constraint is a limitation that individuals, businesses, and governments face regarding their income or resources and the expenses they can afford to incur.
- Explanation: It represents the trade-offs people have to make between different goods and services due to limited resources.
- Example: If an individual has a budget constraint of $100 per week for groceries, they must decide how much to spend on each item while staying within that limit.

## Budget deficit
- Definition: A budget deficit occurs when a government spends more money than it earns in revenue over a specific period, usually a year.
- Explanation: It's an indication that the government is borrowing money to meet its expenses, which adds to the national debt.
- Example: If a government spends $1 trillion but only earns $900 billion in revenue during a fiscal year, it will have a budget deficit of $100 billion.

## Budget line
- Definition: A budget line is a graphical representation of the combinations of two goods that an individual or household can purchase given a fixed budget and prices.
- Explanation: It shows the maximum quantities of goods or services that can be purchased with the available budget at prevailing market prices.
- Example: If an individual has a budget of $500 and wants to buy apples and oranges, the budget line will show the different combinations of these two fruits that they can afford based on their prices.

## Budget surplus
- Definition: A budget surplus occurs when a government's revenues exceed its expenditures over a specific period, usually a year.
- Explanation: It means that the government generates more income than it spends, allowing it to reduce its debt or invest in other areas.
- Example: If a government collects $1.2 trillion in revenue and spends $1 trillion during a fiscal year, it will have a budget surplus of $200 billion.

## Business cycle
- Definition: The business cycle refers to the pattern of fluctuations in economic activity over time, characterized by alternating periods of expansion and contraction.
- Explanation: It includes four phases – expansion, peak, contraction, and trough – that reflect changes in production, employment, income, and other macroeconomic variables.
- Example: During an expansion phase, the economy grows, employment increases, and output expands. In contrast, during a contraction phase, the economy contracts, unemployment rises, and output slows down.

## Capital
- Definition: Capital refers to the financial resources, machinery, equipment, buildings, and other assets used to produce goods and services.
- Explanation: It is a critical input in the production process and plays a vital role in economic growth and development.
- Example: Examples of capital include factories, machines, computers, vehicles, and tools that companies use to manufacture products or provide services.

## Capital accumulation
- Definition: Capital accumulation refers to the increase in the stock of physical and financial capital in an economy over time.
- Explanation: It occurs when savings are channeled into investment, leading to higher levels of productivity, output, and income.
- Example: When a company reinvests a portion of its profits into new machinery or technology, it is engaging in capital accumulation.

## Capital flight
- Definition: Capital flight refers to the large-scale movement of financial assets from one country to another in response to political or economic uncertainties.
- Explanation: It can destabilize domestic financial markets, reduce investment, and slow down economic growth.
- Example: If a country experiences political turmoil or hyperinflation, investors may move their funds abroad to safer and more stable locations.

## Capital gain
- Definition: A capital gain is the profit made from selling a capital asset, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or other investments, at a higher price than its cost.
- Explanation: It represents the difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the asset and is subject to capital gains tax.
- Example: If an investor buys a stock for $10 per share and sells it for $20 per share, they realize a capital gain of $10 per share.

## Capital stock
- Definition: Capital stock refers to the total value of physical and financial capital that is available for use in an economy.
- Explanation: It includes all the fixed assets, such as buildings, machinery, and infrastructure, as well as financial assets like stocks and bonds.
- Example: The capital stock of a country reflects its level of investment and can influence its long-term economic growth and productivity.

## Cartel
- Definition: A group of firms or countries that collude together to limit competition and control the market by fixing prices and output levels.
- Explanation: Cartels are formed to maximize profits by acting as a monopolistic entity in the market. Members of a cartel agree to set prices and production levels, divide up markets, and coordinate their actions.
- Example: OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) is one of the most well-known cartels, which controls the global oil market by limiting output to increase prices.

## Central bank
- Definition: A financial institution that manages a country's monetary policy, issues currency, and regulates the country's banking system.
- Explanation: The central bank acts as the government's banker and lender of last resort, oversees the country's payments system, and maintains the stability of the financial system.
- Example: The Federal Reserve System (the Fed) in the United States is the central bank that oversees the country's monetary policy and banking system.

## Ceteris paribus 
- Definition: A Latin term meaning "all other things being equal" used in economic analysis to isolate the effect of one variable while holding all others constant.
- Explanation: Ceteris paribus is an assumption made in economics to simplify analysis and understand the relationship between two variables without the influence of other factors.
- Example: If we want to study the relationship between the price of a product and its demand, we assume ceteris paribus to hold all other factors constant, such as income, taste, and preferences.

## Circular flow of income
- Definition: A model that shows the flow of goods, services, and factors of production between households and firms in an economy.
- Explanation: The circular flow of income describes how households receive income by selling their labor to firms, which in turn produce and sell goods and services back to households. The model also includes the role of government spending and international trade.
- Example: When a household buys groceries from a firm, it exchanges money for goods and services, which becomes income for the firm. The income received by the firm can then be used to pay wages to workers, rent to landlords, and profits to owners.

## Coase theorem
- Definition: A proposition that states that in the absence of transaction costs, private bargaining between parties will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the legal assignment of property rights.
- Explanation: The Coase theorem suggests that if transaction costs are low, the market participants will bargain to reach an efficient outcome, regardless of who has the property rights. The theorem also underscores the importance of reducing transaction costs to improve market efficiency.
- Example: If a farmer's cows cause damages to a neighboring field, the Coase theorem suggests that, in the absence of transaction costs, the farmer and the neighbor can negotiate to reach an efficient outcome for compensating the damage.

## Cobb-Douglas production function
- Definition: A mathematical formula used to represent the relationship between inputs of labor and capital and the output of a production process. It assumes that output is a function of capital and labor raised to some exponent values.
- Explanation: The Cobb-Douglas production function is widely used in economic analysis to estimate the optimal combination of inputs to maximize output. The function assumes that output increases with more capital and labor inputs but at a decreasing rate.
- Example: A manufacturing company uses the Cobb-Douglas production function to determine the optimal mix of labor and capital inputs to produce a certain level of output.

## Collateral
- Definition: An asset pledged as security for a loan that may be seized by the lender if the borrower defaults on the loan.
- Explanation: Collateral is a form of guarantee provided by the borrower to the lender to mitigate the risk of default. The value of the collateral typically corresponds to the amount of the loan, and it can be a physical asset, such as a house or car, or a financial asset, such as stocks or bonds.
- Example: A person may offer their home as collateral when taking out a mortgage loan from a bank.

## Collusion
- Definition: An illegal agreement between two or more companies or individuals to limit competition in a market by coordinating their actions, such as setting prices or dividing up territories.
- Explanation: Collusion is an antitrust violation because it leads to higher prices and lower output, harming consumers and restricting free-market competition. Collusion can be difficult to detect and prosecute.
- Example: Two competing gas stations in a small town agree to keep their gas prices high to increase profits, which harms consumers who have few alternatives to buy gas.

## Command economy
- Definition: An economic system in which the government or a central authority controls and makes all decisions regarding production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services.
- Explanation: In a command economy, the government owns and controls all resources and makes all economic decisions without any input from the market or consumers.
- Example: The former Soviet Union is an example of a command economy.

## Commodity
- Definition: A raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee.
- Explanation: Commodity refers to goods that are produced and traded for profit, often with standardized quality and price.
- Example: Examples of commodities include gold, silver, crude oil, wheat, corn, and soybeans.

## Common good
- Definition: A good or service that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that it is available to everyone and consumption by one individual does not reduce its availability to others.
- Explanation: The common good benefits society as a whole rather than individuals or private parties.
- Example: Examples of common goods include clean air, public parks, and national defense.

## Comparative advantage
- Definition: The ability of a country or firm to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than competitors.
- Explanation: Comparative advantage is based on the idea that countries or firms should specialize in producing the goods or services they can produce most efficiently.
- Example: If Country A can produce 20 units of cloth or 10 units of wine using all its resources, while Country B can produce 15 units of cloth or 5 units of wine, then Country A has a comparative advantage in producing cloth and should specialize in producing it.

## Comparative statics
- Definition: A method used in economics to analyze how changes in the values of variables affect economic outcomes or equilibrium points.
- Explanation: Comparative statics involves comparing two or more different outcomes under different sets of conditions or assumptions to see how changes in variables affect these outcomes.
- Example: If the price of gasoline increases by 10%, comparative statics can be used to analyze how this will affect the quantity demanded of gasoline, the profits of firms that produce gasoline, and the welfare of consumers who purchase gasoline.

## Complement good
- Definition: A good that is typically consumed together with another good. 
- Explanation: A complement good has a negative cross-price elasticity of demand, meaning that as the price of one good goes up, the demand for both goods goes down.
- Example: Examples of complement goods include peanut butter and jelly, computer hardware and software, and cars and gasoline.

## Consumer choice theory
- Definition: A theory that explains how consumers make choices about what goods and services to buy based on their preferences, budget constraints, and information about prices and product characteristics.
- Explanation: Consumer choice theory assumes that consumers seek to maximize their utility or satisfaction from consuming different goods and services subject to their budget constraints.
- Example: Consumer choice theory can be used to explain why someone might choose to buy a more expensive brand of cereal if they believe that it tastes better or has higher quality ingredients.

## Consumer confidence index (CCI)
- Definition: The CCI is an economic indicator that measures the level of optimism or pessimism consumers have regarding the economy's future prospects.
- Explanation: The CCI is calculated based on surveys of consumer attitudes and opinions about their income, employment, and general economic conditions. A high CCI indicates that consumers are optimistic about the economy's future, while a low CCI suggests pessimism.
- Example: If the CCI is above 100, it indicates that consumers are more optimistic about the economy's future, which may lead to increased spending, investment, and economic growth.

## Consumer equilibrium
- Definition: Consumer equilibrium is a state where a consumer maximizes their utility subject to their budget constraints by allocating their income between different goods and services in such a way that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods.
- Explanation: In other words, consumer equilibrium occurs when a consumer has allocated their budget in a way that they cannot increase their total utility by reallocating their expenditures among different goods and services.
- Example: A consumer who spends $10 on pizza and $5 on sandwiches per week will reach consumer equilibrium if the additional utility gained by spending one more dollar on pizza is equal to the additional utility gained by spending one more dollar on sandwiches.

## Consumer price index (CPI)
- Definition: CPI is an economic indicator that measures the average change in the prices paid by households for a basket of goods and services over time.
- Explanation: CPI is calculated by comparing the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services over time. It can be used to measure inflation and determine changes in purchasing power.
- Example: If the CPI increases from 120 to 130, it suggests that the cost of the basket of goods and services has increased by 8.3%.

## Consumer sovereignty
- Definition: Consumer sovereignty is an economic principle that states that consumers determine what goods and services are produced through their choices and demand for products.
- Explanation: In other words, producers respond to consumer preferences, and the market allocates resources based on consumer demand.
- Example: If consumers prefer electric cars over gasoline-powered cars, producers will shift their focus towards producing more electric cars to meet consumer demand.

## Consumer surplus
- Definition: Consumer surplus refers to the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price they pay.
- Explanation: Consumer surplus represents the benefit that consumers receive from consuming a good or service and is measured as the area below the demand curve and above the price paid.
- Example: If a consumer is willing to pay $50 for a concert ticket but only pays $30, their consumer surplus is $20.

## Consumption
- Definition: Consumption refers to the purchase and use of final goods and services by households.
- Explanation: Consumption is an important component of gross domestic product (GDP) and is a key indicator of overall economic activity.
- Example: If households spend $1,000 on groceries, $500 on rent, and $200 on entertainment in a month, their consumption expenditure is $1,700.

## Consumption function
- Definition: The consumption function is a mathematical relationship between disposable income and consumption expenditure.
- Explanation: The consumption function shows how changes in disposable income affect consumption. It is usually represented as an equation, where consumption expenditure is a function of disposable income and some constant terms.
- Example: If the consumption function is C = a + b(Yd), where C is consumption expenditure, a is autonomous consumption, b is the marginal propensity to consume, and Yd is disposable income, then an increase in disposable income will result in an increase in consumption expenditure.

## Contractionary fiscal policy
- Definition: Contractionary fiscal policy refers to government policies aimed at reducing aggregate demand and slowing down the economy, typically by decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes.
- Explanation: Contractionary fiscal policy is used to combat inflation and stabilize the economy during periods of high economic growth.
- Example: If the government decreases its spending on infrastructure projects during an economic expansion, it can reduce inflationary pressures by decreasing aggregate demand.

## Contractionary monetary policy
- Definition: Contractionary monetary policy refers to central bank policies aimed at reducing the money supply and increasing interest rates to slow down the economy and combat inflation.
- Explanation: Contractionary monetary policy is used to reduce inflationary pressures during periods of high economic growth.
- Example: If the central bank increases the reserve requirement and sells government securities in the open market, it can reduce the money supply and increase interest rates, which can help slow down the economy.

## Cost of living
- Definition: The amount of money needed to maintain a certain standard of living.
- Explanation: Cost of living is the sum of expenses required to sustain a certain lifestyle, including housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and other necessities.
- Example: The cost of living in New York City is higher than in a small town in Iowa.

## Cost-benefit analysis
- Definition: A process used to evaluate the potential costs and benefits of a decision or project.
- Explanation: Cost-benefit analysis involves comparing the total expected costs of a decision or project against its expected benefits to determine whether it is worth pursuing.
- Example: A company may conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether investing in a new product line will be profitable.

## Cost-push inflation
- Definition: A type of inflation caused by an increase in production costs resulting in higher prices for goods and services.
- Explanation: Cost-push inflation occurs when the cost of producing goods increases, leading to a rise in prices. This can happen due to factors such as increased wages, taxes, or raw material costs.
- Example: If the cost of oil increases, transportation costs will rise, resulting in higher prices for goods at supermarkets.

## Creative destruction
- Definition: A theory that states that innovation and technological progress lead to the decline or destruction of older industries and the creation of new ones.
- Explanation: Creative destruction refers to the process of innovation and technological advancement making some industries obsolete while creating new ones.
- Example: The introduction of automobiles led to the decline of horse-drawn carriages and blacksmiths but created jobs in automobile manufacturing and repair.

## Credit
- Definition: The ability to borrow money or access goods and services with the promise to pay back in the future.
- Explanation: Credit is a financial tool that allows individuals and businesses to access capital they may not have available upfront. In return, the borrower agrees to repay the borrowed funds plus interest over time.
- Example: A person may use a credit card to purchase items that they cannot afford to pay for immediately, agreeing to pay back the amount owed plus interest in monthly installments.

## Cross elasticity of demand (XED)
- Definition: A measure of how much the demand for one good changes in response to a change in the price of another good.
- Explanation: Cross elasticity of demand measures the sensitivity of the demand for one good to changes in the price of another good. It is calculated as the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good divided by the percentage change in the price of another good.
- Example: If the price of coffee increases and the demand for tea increases, then the cross elasticity of demand between coffee and tea is positive.

## Crowding in
- Definition: An increase in private sector investment or spending resulting from government spending or policies.
- Explanation: Crowding in refers to the phenomenon where increased government spending or policies lead to an increase in private sector investment or spending. This can happen when government actions increase demand for goods and services, leading to more private sector investment.
- Example: The government increasing spending on infrastructure projects can lead to increased demand for steel, concrete, and other construction materials, which then leads to increased private sector investment in those industries.

## Crowding out
- Definition: A decrease in private sector investment or spending resulting from government spending or policies.
- Explanation: Crowding out refers to the phenomenon where increased government spending or policies lead to a decrease in private sector investment or spending. This can happen when government actions increase demand for goods and services, leading to higher prices, reduced profits, and decreased private sector investment.
- Example: If the government increases spending on healthcare, private health insurance providers may reduce their investment in the industry due to increased competition.

## Currency
- Definition: A medium of exchange used to facilitate transactions between individuals or businesses.
- Explanation: Currency is a form of money that is widely accepted as payment for goods and services. It can take physical forms such as paper bills or coins, or digital forms such as electronic bank transfers or cryptocurrency.
- Example: The US dollar is a widely accepted currency used for transactions in the United States and many other countries.

## Currency appreciation
- Definition: An increase in the value of a country's currency in relation to other currencies.
- Explanation: This means that one unit of the currency can buy more units of other currencies than before. It often occurs when there is an increase in demand for the country's goods and services, or when there is a decrease in supply of the country's currency in the foreign exchange market.
- Example: If the US dollar appreciates against the euro, it means that one US dollar can buy more euros than before.

## Currency depreciation 
- Definition: A decrease in the value of a country's currency in relation to other currencies.
- Explanation: This means that one unit of the currency can buy fewer units of other currencies than before. It often occurs when there is a decrease in demand for the country's goods and services, or when there is an increase in supply of the country's currency in the foreign exchange market.
- Example: If the British pound depreciates against the Japanese yen, it means that one pound can buy fewer yen than before.

## Cyclical unemployment
- Definition: Unemployment that results from fluctuations in economic activity, such as recessions and booms.
- Explanation: When the economy enters into a recession or downturn, businesses may lay off workers or reduce their working hours, resulting in cyclical unemployment. Conversely, during an economic boom, businesses may hire more workers, reducing cyclical unemployment.
- Example: During the 2008 financial crisis, many companies reduced their workforce due to declining demand, leading to an increase in cyclical unemployment.

## Deadweight loss 
- Definition: The loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium for a good or service is not achieved due to market distortions, such as taxes or subsidies.
- Explanation: Deadweight loss refers to the inefficiency created by market distortions, where some transactions that would have been mutually beneficial do not occur. This can result in a loss of economic welfare, as some buyers and sellers are prevented from engaging in mutually beneficial transactions.
- Example: If the government imposes a tax on cigarettes, this may lead to a decrease in the quantity of cigarettes sold, but also a decrease in economic efficiency due to the deadweight loss created by the tax.

## Deficit spending 
- Definition: Spending more money than is collected in revenue over a given period.
- Explanation: Deficit spending can be used to stimulate economic growth, as it injects more money into the economy, creating demand for goods and services. However, it can also lead to inflation and higher interest rates, depending on how the deficit is financed.
- Example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments engaged in deficit spending to provide stimulus and support to their economies, which helped to mitigate the effects of the crisis.

## Deflation
- Definition: A sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services in an economy, usually accompanied by a decrease in the money supply.
- Explanation: Deflation is the opposite of inflation and can occur due to various factors, such as a decrease in demand, an increase in productivity, or a decrease in the money supply. Deflation can lead to lower interest rates and increased purchasing power, but it can also lead to economic stagnation and increased debt burdens.
- Example: Japan experienced deflation for most of the 1990s and 2000s, which contributed to the country's economic malaise during this period.

## Demand
- Definition: The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price and time.
- Explanation: Demand is an essential concept in economics, as it determines the prices of goods and services and helps to allocate scarce resources efficiently. Factors that can affect demand include changes in consumer tastes and preferences, changes in income levels, and changes in the prices of related goods and services.
- Example: If the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded by consumers will usually decrease, assuming all other factors remain constant.

## Demand Curve
- Definition: A graph showing the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded by consumers.
- Explanation: The demand curve slopes downwards, indicating that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, holding other factors constant. Conversely, as the price of a good or service decreases, the quantity demanded increases, holding other factors constant.
- Example: An example of a demand curve would be the graph of the number of hamburgers people would buy at different prices.

## Demand Deposit
- Definition: Money deposited in a bank account that can be withdrawn by the account holder without prior notice or penalty.
- Explanation: A demand deposit is also known as a checking or current account, which allows individuals or businesses to withdraw money on demand.
- Example: When an individual deposits money into their checking account, they can use the funds to pay bills, make purchases, or withdraw cash from ATMs.

## Demand Schedule
- Definition: A table showing the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at different prices.
- Explanation: A demand schedule lists the various prices of a good or service and the corresponding quantities demanded by consumers, assuming all other factors remain constant.
- Example: A demand schedule for coffee might list the quantity of coffee that consumers will purchase at various prices, such as $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00 per cup.

## Demand-Pull Inflation
- Definition: A type of inflation caused by an increase in demand for goods and services that outpaces the supply of those goods and services.
- Explanation: Demand-pull inflation occurs when the economy is operating at full employment, and aggregate demand continues to increase, causing prices to rise.
- Example: When there is a surge in consumer spending, it can cause demand-pull inflation, as producers struggle to keep up with the increased demand for goods and services.

## Demerit Good
- Definition: A good whose consumption creates negative externalities or has harmful effects on individuals or society.
- Explanation: Demerit goods are considered socially undesirable because their consumption harms either the consumer or others in society.
- Example: Examples of demerit goods include tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs, which can have negative health effects on the individual and contribute to increased healthcare costs.

## Depreciation
- Definition: A reduction in the value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or changes in market conditions.
- Explanation: Depreciation reflects the decrease in an asset's value over time and is typically calculated as a percentage of the asset's initial cost.
- Example: A car loses value as it ages due to wear and tear and changing market conditions, resulting in depreciation.

## Depreciation (of Capital)
- Definition: The decline in the value of capital goods, such as machinery and equipment, over time due to physical wear and tear, technological advances, or changes in market conditions.
- Explanation: Depreciation of capital is accounted for as an expense on a company's income statement, reflecting the decline in the value of its capital assets.
- Example: A manufacturing firm may depreciate the value of its production equipment over time as the machines become outdated or wear out.

## Deregulation
- Definition: The removal of government regulations or restrictions on businesses and industries, allowing them to operate more freely in the marketplace.
- Explanation: Deregulation aims to promote competition and efficiency by reducing barriers to entry and limiting government intervention in the marketplace.
- Example: The deregulation of the airline industry in the United States in the late 1970s allowed airlines to set their own fares and routes, leading to increased competition and lower prices for consumers.

## Derived demand
- Definition: The demand for a good or service that arises from the demand for another good or service.
- Explanation: When the demand for one product increases, the demand for the products used to produce it will also increase, resulting in an increase in the demand for those products as well.
- Example: The demand for steel is derived from the demand for automobiles, since steel is used to manufacture cars.

## Devaluation
- Definition: A decrease in the value of a currency compared to other currencies.
- Explanation: Devaluation can occur due to various economic factors such as inflation, trade imbalances or changes in interest rates.
- Example: If a country's central bank decreases the value of its currency relative to other currencies, the price of imported goods will rise and exports will become cheaper.

## Development indicators
- Definition: Statistical measures that provide information about the level of development of a particular country or region.
- Explanation: Development indicators are used to compare different countries or regions in terms of their economic, social, and environmental progress over time.
- Example: Some commonly used development indicators include Gross Domestic Product (GDP), literacy rate, life expectancy, and poverty rate.

## Diminishing marginal product
- Definition: The decrease in the additional output produced when one more unit of input is added while holding other inputs constant.
- Explanation: It occurs when the productivity of each additional unit of input decreases as the number of units of input increases.
- Example: In agriculture, the first few workers may be able to plant crops quickly, but as more workers are added, each additional worker contributes less and less to the total crop yield.

## Diminishing marginal utility
- Definition: The decrease in satisfaction or usefulness that a consumer derives from consuming each additional unit of a good or service.
- Explanation: As consumption of a good or service increases, the marginal utility of each additional unit consumed decreases.
- Example: As a person eats more slices of pizza, the enjoyment they derive from each additional slice diminishes.

## Diminishing returns
- Definition: A point at which the level of profits or benefits gained is less than the amount of money or energy invested.
- Explanation: As more resources are invested into a particular activity, the additional benefit gained from each additional unit of investment decreases.
- Example: If a firm keeps adding labor to a production process without increasing its capital stock, there comes a point where each additional worker contributes so little to output that the cost of hiring them outweighs the benefits.

## Diseconomies of scale
- Definition: A situation in which the cost of producing additional units of a good or service increases as more output is produced.
- Explanation: This occurs when the company grows too large and becomes difficult to manage, leading to higher costs.
- Example: A factory that produces 100 units of a product per day may have lower costs per unit than a factory that produces 1000 units per day due to the increased complexity of managing a larger facility.

## Disequilibrium price
- Definition: A market price at which quantity supplied does not equal quantity demanded.
- Explanation: Disequilibrium prices occur when there is excess supply or demand in the market, leading to either a surplus or a shortage of goods.
- Example: If the price of a popular toy is set too high, consumers may not be willing to purchase it, creating a surplus of toys that cannot be sold at that price. Alternatively, if the price is set too low, suppliers may not produce enough toys to meet demand, leading to a shortage.

## Disequilibrium quantity
- Definition: The quantity at which the quantity demanded and supplied of a good or service are not equal, resulting in a shortage or surplus.
- Explanation: Disequilibrium quantity occurs when the market is not in equilibrium, which can lead to inefficient allocation of resources and price changes.
- Example: If the demand for a product suddenly increases while the supply remains constant, a shortage occurs, and the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, resulting in disequilibrium quantity.

## Disinflation
- Definition: A decrease in the rate of inflation over time, resulting in a slowdown in the general rise of prices.
- Explanation: Disinflation occurs when the inflation rate decreases but does not turn negative. It can happen naturally or be induced by monetary policy.
- Example: If the inflation rate in a country was 4% last year and is now 2%, it has experienced disinflation.

## Disposable income
- Definition: Income remaining after deducting taxes and other mandatory charges, which consumers can use for personal expenses or saving.
- Explanation: Disposable income is the amount of money individuals have available to spend or save after paying their bills and taxes.
- Example: An individual's disposable income would be calculated by subtracting income tax, social security tax, and any other mandatory deductions from their gross income.

## Diversification
- Definition: Investing in a variety of assets or products to reduce risk and increase potential returns.
- Explanation: Diversification aims to minimize risk by spreading investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, rather than concentrating on one particular type of investment.
- Example: Instead of investing all their money in one stock, an investor may choose to diversify by investing in multiple stocks across different industries.

## Dividend
- Definition: A payment made by a company to its shareholders, usually in cash but sometimes in stock, representing a portion of profits or earnings.
- Explanation: Dividends are a form of reward to shareholders for owning shares in a company and are typically paid out regularly, such as quarterly or annually.
- Example: A company that earns a profit of $1 million may decide to pay out $100,000 in dividends to its shareholders.

## Divisibility
- Definition: The property of being divisible or easily divided into smaller parts without losing value or function.
- Explanation: Divisibility is an important characteristic of money or any other valuable asset because it allows for easier transactions and greater flexibility.
- Example: A dollar bill is divisible into coins and smaller denominations, making it easier to buy items of varying prices.

## Dumping
- Definition: Selling goods or services below cost in a foreign market with the aim of driving out competition and gaining market share.
- Explanation: Dumping is considered an unfair trade practice and is often regulated by governments to protect domestic producers from foreign competition.
- Example: A company producing steel in one country sells it for less than the cost of production in another country, hurting domestic steel producers and driving them out of business.

## Duopoly
- Definition: A market structure in which only two companies dominate the market and compete with each other for customers.
- Explanation: In a duopoly, the actions of one company can affect the pricing and market share of the other company, leading to interdependence and strategic decision-making.
- Example: The soft drink industry in the United States is dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which compete fiercely with each other for market share.

## Economic development
- Definition: The process by which a country or region improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people.
- Explanation: It involves increasing the production of goods and services, improving infrastructure, creating job opportunities, and reducing poverty and inequality. 
- Example: A developing country like Ethiopia investing in building new roads, schools, and healthcare facilities to improve living standards and create jobs.

## Economic growth
- Definition: An increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.
- Explanation: It is typically measured by changes in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which represents the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. 
- Example: China's rapid economic growth over the past few decades, which has led to significant improvements in living standards for many Chinese citizens.

## Economic integration
- Definition: The process by which separate economies are combined into a larger and more complex unit, typically through the removal of barriers to trade and investment.
- Explanation: It can take various forms, including free trade agreements, customs unions, and common markets, and is designed to increase economic efficiency and promote economic growth. 
- Example: The European Union, where member states have removed barriers to trade and investment among themselves and created a single market for goods and services.

## Economic model
- Definition: A simplified representation of an economic system or phenomenon that is used to understand and predict economic behavior.
- Explanation: Models can be used to study the behavior of consumers, firms, and governments, and to analyze the effects of policies and other interventions on the economy. 
- Example: A supply and demand model, which shows how the quantity of a good or service demanded by consumers and the quantity supplied by producers interact to determine the price of the good or service.

## Economic profit
- Definition: The difference between total revenue and total economic costs, where economic costs include both explicit (out-of-pocket) and implicit (opportunity) costs.
- Explanation: Economic profit is a measure of the profitability of a business or investment and takes into account the opportunity cost of using resources to produce a particular good or service. 
- Example: A company earning $1 million in revenue but with $800,000 in explicit costs and $300,000 in implicit costs would have an economic profit of -$100,000.

## Economic rent
- Definition: A payment to a factor of production (such as labor, land, or capital) that exceeds the minimum amount necessary to keep that factor in its current use.
- Explanation: Economic rent is a type of surplus payment that arises when a factor of production is scarce or has unique qualities that make it highly valuable. 
- Example: A professional athlete who earns millions of dollars in salary each year may be receiving economic rent due to their unique skills and abilities.

## Economic resources
- Definition: The inputs used in the production of goods and services, including natural resources, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.
- Explanation: Economic resources are limited in supply and must be allocated efficiently to maximize economic output and improve living standards. 
- Example: Oil reserves, human labor, factories, and startups are all examples of economic resources.

## Economic shock
- Definition: A sudden and unexpected event that disrupts an economy, such as a financial crisis, natural disaster, or major policy change.
- Explanation: Economic shocks can lead to significant fluctuations in economic activity, employment, and prices, and can have long-lasting effects on an economy. 
- Example: The 2008 financial crisis, which led to a global recession and resulted in significant job losses and declines in asset prices around the world.

## Economic system
- Definition: An economic system is a particular set of institutional arrangements and a coordinating mechanism used to allocate scarce resources, such as labor, capital, and natural resources, among competing uses.
- Explanation: Economic systems differ in terms of who owns the means of production, how they are allocated, and how goods and services are distributed. Some examples include capitalism, socialism, and communism.
- Example: The United States has a capitalist economic system where private individuals and companies own most of the means of production.

## Economies of scale
- Definition: Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that a business can achieve by increasing its level of production.
- Explanation: As businesses produce more, their fixed costs (such as rent and equipment) can be spread over a larger number of units, leading to lower average costs per unit of output.
- Example: A car manufacturer may be able to negotiate better prices for raw materials if it is producing more cars, leading to lower costs per car produced.

## Edgeworth box
- Definition: An Edgeworth box is a graphical representation used to analyze how two individuals or groups can benefit from trade when they have different endowments of goods and services.
- Explanation: The box represents all possible allocations of the two goods between the two individuals or groups, and the contract curve represents the efficient allocations that would arise through voluntary trade.
- Example: An Edgeworth box could be used to show how a buyer and seller can reach a mutually beneficial agreement on price and quantity in a market.

## Effective demand
- Definition: Effective demand refers to the willingness and ability of consumers to purchase goods and services at a given price level.
- Explanation: Effective demand takes into account both the desire to consume a good or service and the ability to pay for it.
- Example: If the price of a luxury car is too high, even those who desire to purchase it may not have the effective demand to actually make the purchase.

## Efficiency
- Definition: Efficiency refers to the use of resources in a way that maximizes outputs while minimizing inputs.
- Explanation: Efficient production means that goods and services are being produced at the lowest possible cost, given the available technology and resources.
- Example: A factory that produces a large number of items using the same amount of raw materials as a less efficient factory would be considered more efficient.

## Elasticity
- Definition: Elasticity refers to the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable.
- Explanation: For example, the price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a change in its price.
- Example: If the price of gasoline increases and people start buying fewer gas-guzzling cars, this would be an example of the price elasticity of demand.

## Elasticity of substitution
- Definition: The elasticity of substitution is a measure of how easily one factor of production, such as labor, can be substituted for another factor, such as capital.
- Explanation: If the two factors are very substitutable, then firms will be more likely to switch from one to the other in response to changes in their relative prices.
- Example: If the price of labor goes up, a firm may substitute more capital for labor in order to keep costs down.

## Elasticity of supply (PES)
- Definition: The elasticity of supply (PES) measures how much the quantity supplied of a good or service changes in response to a change in its price.
- Explanation: If producers are able to quickly and easily adjust their production levels in response to price changes, then the PES will be high. If they are unable to adjust production levels quickly, then the PES will be low.
- Example: If the price of strawberries increases, farmers may plant more strawberry plants in response, but it may take some time for these plants to mature and start producing fruit, resulting in a relatively low PES in the short run.

## Embargo
- Definition: A government-imposed restriction on trade or commercial activity with a particular country, group of countries, or a specific product.
- Explanation: An embargo is often used as a political tool to exert pressure on a country to change its behavior or to protect domestic industries.
- Example: The United States imposed an embargo on Cuba in 1962, restricting trade and travel between the two countries.

## Endogenous variable
- Definition: A variable that is influenced by other variables within a system or model.
- Explanation: Endogenous variables are typically used in economic models to explain the relationships between different economic factors.
- Example: In a supply and demand model, price would be considered an endogenous variable because it is influenced by changes in both supply and demand.

## Engel curve
- Definition: A graphical representation of the relationship between an individual's income and their spending on a particular good or service.
- Explanation: Engel curves are often used to analyze consumer behavior and understand how changes in income affect spending habits.
- Example: An Engel curve for food might show that as income increases, the percentage of income spent on food decreases.

## Entrepreneur
- Definition: A person who starts and operates a new business venture, assuming all the risks and rewards of the venture.
- Explanation: Entrepreneurs are typically characterized by their creativity, innovation, and willingness to take on risk in pursuit of their business ideas.

- Explanation: Entrepreneurship involves identifying a market opportunity, developing a business plan, securing funding, and executing on the plan to launch a successful business.
- Example: A person who starts a new tech company and grows it into a successful enterprise is engaging in entrepreneurship.

## Equilibrium
- Definition: A state in which supply and demand are balanced and there is no tendency for prices to rise or fall.
- Explanation: Equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded by buyers equals the quantity supplied by sellers at a given price level.
- Example: In a free market economy, prices will tend toward equilibrium as buyers and sellers adjust their behaviors in response to changing market conditions.

## Equilibrium price
- Definition: The price at which the quantity demanded by buyers equals the quantity supplied by sellers, resulting in a state of equilibrium.
- Explanation: The equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves in a market.
- Example: If the equilibrium price for a gallon of milk is $3.00, then buyers will purchase exactly the same amount of milk that sellers are willing to offer at that price.

## Equilibrium quantity
- Definition: The quantity of a good or service that is bought and sold at the equilibrium price in a market.
- Explanation: The equilibrium quantity is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves in a market.
- Example: If the equilibrium quantity for a gallon of milk is 100 units, then 100 units of milk will be bought and sold at the equilibrium price.

## Equimarginal principle
- Definition: The equimarginal principle is an economic concept that states that a consumer should allocate their expenditures between different goods and services in such a way that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all purchases.
- Explanation: The principle suggests that a consumer will achieve maximum satisfaction when the last dollar spent on each good provides equal marginal utility.
- Example: A person with $10 to spend can buy either three hamburgers for $2 each or two hot dogs for $2.50 each. According to the equimarginal principle, they should buy two hot dogs and one hamburger because the marginal utility per dollar spent on both options is equal.

## Equity
- Definition: Equity refers to fairness and justness in the distribution of resources and benefits among individuals or groups.
- Explanation: It involves treating everyone fairly and without discrimination in terms of access to opportunities, rights, and rewards.
- Example: In a company, equity may mean paying employees the same salary for the same job regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.

## Excess demand
- Definition: Excess demand occurs when the quantity of a good or service demanded by consumers exceeds the quantity supplied by producers at a given price level.
- Explanation: This leads to a shortage in the market as buyers compete for the limited supply, causing prices to rise until the market reaches equilibrium.
- Example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an excess demand for face masks, hand sanitizers, and other personal protective equipment, leading to shortages and price increases.

## Excess reserves 
- Definition: Excess reserves refer to the amount of money that banks hold beyond what is required by law or regulation.
- Explanation: These reserves serve as a cushion against unexpected withdrawals, enabling banks to meet their obligations and maintain their liquidity.
- Example: If a bank is required to keep 10% of its deposits in reserves and it holds 12%, the 2% difference is considered excess reserves.

## Excess supply
- Definition: Excess supply occurs when the quantity of a good or service supplied by producers exceeds the quantity demanded by consumers at a given price level.
- Explanation: This leads to a surplus in the market as sellers compete to sell their goods, causing prices to fall until the market reaches equilibrium.
- Example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an excess supply of oil and gas as travel restrictions reduced demand, leading to a decrease in prices.

## Exchange rate
- Definition: An exchange rate is the value of one currency in relation to another currency, used to determine the value of international transactions.
- Explanation: It indicates how much of one currency is needed to purchase a unit of another currency and is influenced by various factors, including inflation rates, interest rates, political stability, and trade policies.
- Example: The exchange rate between the US dollar and the Euro might be 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, indicating that one US dollar can buy 0.85 Euros.

## Exchange rate regime
- Definition: The exchange rate regime refers to the system used by a country to determine the value of its currency in relation to other currencies.
- Explanation: There are several types of exchange rate regimes, including fixed, floating, managed float, and pegged systems, which differ in their degree of flexibility and government intervention in the foreign exchange market.
- Example: China has a managed float exchange rate regime, which means that the government intervenes in the foreign exchange market to maintain stability in the value of its currency.

## Exogenous variable
- Definition: An exogenous variable is a variable whose value is determined outside of the model or system being analyzed.
- Explanation: It is typically assumed to be constant or at least not affected by the variables within the system and is used to explain the behavior of endogenous variables within the system.
- Example: In a model of the economy, the interest rate may be considered an exogenous variable since it is determined by the central bank and not influenced by changes in economic activity.

## Expansionary fiscal policy
- Definition: A macroeconomic policy that involves increasing government spending and/or reducing taxes to stimulate economic activity.
- Explanation: This policy aims to boost aggregate demand by putting more money in the hands of consumers and businesses, which can lead to increased investing, hiring, and consumption. 
- Example: During a recession, the government may implement an expansionary fiscal policy to mitigate the impact of the downturn by increasing public investment in infrastructure projects.

## Expansionary monetary policy
- Definition: An economic policy that involves decreasing interest rates and increasing the money supply to stimulate economic growth.
- Explanation: By lowering borrowing costs, this policy aims to encourage businesses and individuals to invest and spend more, ultimately boosting aggregate demand and stimulating economic activity.
- Example: The Federal Reserve implemented an expansionary monetary policy during the 2008 financial crisis, by lowering interest rates and implementing quantitative easing to increase the money supply.

## Expected value
- Definition: The weighted average of all possible outcomes of a random variable, where each outcome is multiplied by its probability of occurring.
- Explanation: The expected value provides insight into the average outcome or return that can be expected from a certain situation or investment, taking into account the likelihood of different outcomes.
- Example: In a coin toss, the expected value of winning is 50% heads (with a value of 1) and 50% tails (with a value of 0), resulting in an expected value of 0.5.

## Expenditure multiplier
- Definition: The ratio of the change in national income to a change in autonomous expenditures, such as government spending or investment.
- Explanation: The expenditure multiplier measures the effect of changes in autonomous expenditures on total output in the economy, taking into account the circular flow of income and the effect of changes in spending on subsequent rounds of spending.
- Example: If a government spending program increases spending by $100 million, and the expenditure multiplier is 2, then total output would increase by $200 million.

## Explicit cost
- Definition: A direct, out-of-pocket cost incurred by a business or individual, for example, the cost of materials or labor.
- Explanation: Explicit costs are easily quantifiable and represent actual expenditures made by the business or individual in order to produce or consume goods or services.
- Example: The explicit cost of producing a car includes the cost of raw materials, labor, and energy required to manufacture the car.

## Externalities
- Definition: The unintended costs or benefits that result from a transaction between two parties and accrue to third parties who are not part of the original transaction.
- Explanation: Externalities occur when actions taken by one party affect others who did not agree to the transaction, and may be positive or negative in nature.
- Example: Pollution created by a factory represents a negative externality because it affects the health and well-being of people living in the surrounding area.

## Factor income
- Definition: Payments received by factors of production, including wages for labor, rent for land, interest for capital, and profit for entrepreneurship.
- Explanation: Factor income represents the income earned by individuals and businesses for their contributions to the production of goods and services in the economy.
- Example: An employee's salary represents a form of factor income, as it is payment for their labor contribution to the production of goods or services.

## Factor market
- Definition: A market where factors of production (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship) are bought and sold.
- Explanation: The factor market is where firms purchase the resources needed to produce goods and services. In this market, the prices of the different factors of production are determined by supply and demand.
- Example: A company hiring employees to work in its factory is an example of a transaction in the factor market.

## Factors of production
- Definition: The inputs used in the production of goods and services, including land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.
- Explanation: Factors of production are the resources that firms use to produce goods and services. They are classified into four categories: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.
- Example: A bakery uses flour (land), workers (labor), ovens (capital), and the owner's skills (entrepreneurship) to produce bread.

## Financial intermediation
- Definition: The process by which financial institutions (such as banks) channel funds from savers to borrowers.
- Explanation: Financial intermediation refers to the role that financial institutions play in connecting savers and borrowers. Banks collect deposits from savers and then lend those funds to borrowers who need them.
- Example: A person deposits money into their savings account at a bank, which the bank then lends out to someone else to buy a car.

## Financial market
- Definition: A market where financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, and currencies) are traded.
- Explanation: The financial market is where individuals and institutions buy and sell financial assets. These assets include stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.
- Example: An individual buys shares of stock in a publicly traded company through a brokerage account.

## Fiscal drag
- Definition: The negative impact on economic growth caused by increases in taxes or decreases in government spending.
- Explanation: Fiscal drag occurs when government policies reduce aggregate demand, leading to slower economic growth. This happens when taxes go up or government spending goes down, reducing the amount of money people have to spend.
- Example: The government raises taxes during a recession to reduce the budget deficit, but this reduces consumer spending and slows down economic growth.

## Fiscal multiplier
- Definition: The effect that changes in government spending or taxation have on the economy.
- Explanation: The fiscal multiplier measures the extent to which changes in government spending or taxation affect economic activity. A higher multiplier means that a given change in government policy has a larger impact on the economy.
- Example: If the government spends $100 billion on infrastructure projects, and the fiscal multiplier is 1.5, then the total increase in economic output will be $150 billion.

## Fiscal policy
- Definition: The use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy.
- Explanation: Fiscal policy is the way in which the government uses its spending and taxation powers to achieve its economic goals. It can involve increasing or decreasing government spending or adjusting tax rates.
- Example: The government implements a stimulus package that includes tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth.

## Fixed costs
- Definition: Costs that do not vary with the level of production.
- Explanation: Fixed costs are expenses that a company incurs that do not change, regardless of how much it produces. Examples include rent, salaries, and insurance premiums.
- Example: A company must pay $10,000 per month in rent for its warehouse, regardless of how many units it produces.

## Fixed exchange rate
- Definition: A fixed exchange rate is a monetary system in which the value of a country's currency is fixed or pegged to the value of another currency or a basket of currencies.
- Explanation: Under a fixed exchange rate system, the central bank of a country intervenes in the foreign exchange market to maintain the exchange rate at the predetermined level. This means that the central bank buys and sells its own currency against the pegged currency to ensure that the exchange rate stays within the agreed-upon range.
- Example: The Chinese yuan is pegged to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate.

## Fixed input
- Definition: A fixed input is a factor of production whose quantity cannot be changed in the short run.
- Explanation: In economics, inputs are the resources required to produce goods and services. Fixed inputs are those inputs that are fixed in the short run, meaning their quantity cannot be adjusted quickly in response to changes in demand or production. Examples of fixed inputs include capital equipment, buildings, and some types of labor.
- Example: A restaurant's kitchen equipment is a fixed input because it cannot be easily expanded or reduced in the short run.

## Flexible exchange rate
- Definition: A flexible exchange rate is a monetary system in which the exchange rate is determined by market forces of supply and demand.
- Explanation: Under a flexible exchange rate system, the exchange rate between two currencies is allowed to fluctuate freely according to changes in the demand and supply for each currency. The central bank of a country may still intervene in the foreign exchange market from time to time to stabilize excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate.
- Example: The US dollar and the euro have a flexible exchange rate system.

## Foreign aid
- Definition: Foreign aid refers to the assistance provided by one country (or organization) to another country to support development, humanitarian, or other purposes.
- Explanation: Foreign aid can take many forms such as grants, loans, technical assistance, and in-kind donations. The aim of foreign aid is to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, improve health and education, and provide disaster relief, among other things.
- Example: The United States provides foreign aid to various countries around the world, including Afghanistan, Haiti, and Syria.

## Foreign direct investment (FDI)
- Definition: Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an investment made by a company or individual in one country into a company located in another country.
- Explanation: FDI occurs when an investor acquires a controlling interest in a foreign company or establishes a new business operation in a foreign country. The purpose of FDI is often to gain access to new markets, resources, or production capabilities or to benefit from lower labor or operating costs in the host country.
- Example: Toyota's establishment of an automobile manufacturing plant in the United States is an example of FDI.

## Foreign exchange market
- Definition: The foreign exchange market (also known as Forex or FX market) is a global decentralized market for trading currencies.
- Explanation: The foreign exchange market is used by banks, corporations, governments, and individuals to buy and sell currencies at current or future prices. The prices of currencies are determined by supply and demand forces in the foreign exchange market.
- Example: An importer who needs to pay for goods in a foreign currency will use the foreign exchange market to buy the necessary amount of foreign currency.

## Foreign exchange reserves
- Definition: Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a central bank in foreign currencies.
- Explanation: Central banks hold foreign exchange reserves to ensure that they have adequate resources to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize exchange rates or to meet international obligations. Foreign exchange reserves typically consist of foreign currencies, gold, and other international monetary assets.
- Example: China holds the largest amount of foreign exchange reserves with over $3 trillion worth of assets.

## Free market
- Definition: A free market is an economic system in which prices are determined by unrestricted competition between privately owned businesses.
- Explanation: Under a free market system, the government has minimal intervention in the economy, and businesses are free to make their own decisions without interference. Prices are set by supply and demand forces, and buyers and sellers are free to negotiate transactions without any external control.
- Example: The United States has a predominantly free market economy.

## Free rider problem
- Definition: A situation where some individuals or businesses benefit from a resource or public good without contributing to its production or maintenance.
- Explanation: The free rider problem arises when it is difficult or impossible to exclude non-contributors from benefiting, which leads to underproduction of the good or resource.
- Example: People using public parks without paying for their maintenance or upkeep.

## Free trade
- Definition: International trade without government-imposed barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies.
- Explanation: Free trade aims to increase global economic integration and efficiency by allowing countries to specialize in producing goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage.
- Example: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

## Frictional inflation
- Definition: Inflation that occurs due to temporary imbalances in the labor market, such as shortages of skilled workers or increased demand for labor.
- Explanation: Frictional inflation results from short-term mismatches between labor supply and demand and can be mitigated through policies that improve the matching of workers with available jobs.
- Example: An increase in demand for nurses during a pandemic causing their wages to rise.

## Frictional unemployment
- Definition: Unemployment that occurs due to temporary transitions between jobs, as workers search for new employment opportunities.
- Explanation: Frictional unemployment is a natural part of any healthy labor market and can be reduced through policies that facilitate job matching and training programs.
- Example: A person who has recently quit their job and is actively searching for a new one.

## Full employment
- Definition: A situation where all willing and able workers who are seeking employment have jobs.
- Explanation: Full employment is considered an optimal state for an economy because it maximizes output and reduces poverty.
- Example: The United States achieving full employment in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

## Game theory
- Definition: A mathematical framework used to study decision-making in strategic interactions between individuals or groups.
- Explanation: Game theory analyzes how rational actors make choices and interact with each other to achieve their desired outcomes.
- Example: The prisoner's dilemma, in which two suspects in a crime must decide whether to cooperate with each other or betray each other to the police.

## GDP deflator
- Definition: A measure of the price level of all goods and services included in gross domestic product (GDP).
- Explanation: The GDP deflator is a broad measure of inflation that takes into account changes in both the prices and quantities of goods and services produced in an economy over time.
- Example: The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) uses the GDP deflator to adjust nominal GDP figures for inflation.

## GDP per capita 
- Definition: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person in a country.
- Explanation: It measures the economic output of a country divided by its total population, indicating the average income and standard of living of each person in that country. 
- Example: If a country has a GDP of $1 trillion and a population of 50 million, its GDP per capita will be $20,000.

## Giffen good 
- Definition: A product whose demand increases as its price also increases.
- Explanation: This unusual phenomenon occurs when a product is considered a necessity by low-income consumers who cannot afford alternatives, so they buy more of it when its price goes up.
- Example: When the price of rice increases, low-income consumers may buy more rice and less costly food items because they cannot afford the latter.

## Gini coefficient 
- Definition: A statistical measure of income or wealth inequality in a society.
- Explanation: The index ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality), with higher values indicating a greater concentration of wealth among fewer people.
- Example: In a society with a Gini coefficient of 0.5, the top 20% of earners may control 70% of the wealth.

## Globalization 
- Definition: The process of increased interconnectedness and integration across national boundaries, including trade, investment, and cultural exchange.
- Explanation: It is driven by advancements in technology and transportation, allowing for the flow of goods, services, ideas, and people across borders.
- Example: The widespread use of the internet and social media platforms enables people worldwide to communicate and share information instantly.

## Government intervention 
- Definition: The actions taken by a government to influence or regulate a country's economy or market.
- Explanation: These actions can include taxation, subsidies, tariffs, price controls, and regulations on businesses.
- Example: Governments may intervene in the healthcare industry by providing subsidies to low-income individuals to cover their medical expenses.

## Gross domestic product (GDP) 
- Definition: The total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period.
- Explanation: It is a key indicator of a country's economic performance and is often used to compare the relative economic strength of different countries.
- Example: If a country produces $10 billion worth of goods and services in one year, its GDP for that year would be $10 billion.

## Gross investment 
- Definition: The total amount of money invested in new capital goods and equipment in a country during a specific period.
- Explanation: It includes spending on construction, machinery, and research and development but excludes replacement investments, such as repairs or maintenance.
- Example: If a company spends $1 million on new machinery and $500,000 on research and development in one year, its gross investment for that year would be $1.5 million.

## Gross national income (GNI)
- Definition: The total income earned by a country's residents and businesses, including income earned abroad.
- Explanation: GNI measures the economic activity of a country and is calculated by adding up all the incomes generated by its residents, businesses, and assets within its borders and overseas. It includes wages, salaries, profits, and taxes paid by individuals and companies.
- Example: If a US-based company earns revenue from its operations in Canada, that revenue will be included in the US's GNI.

## Gross national product (GNP)
- Definition: The total value of all goods and services produced by a country's residents and businesses, regardless of their location.
- Explanation: GNP measures the output of a country and takes into account the production of its residents and businesses, regardless of whether it occurs domestically or overseas. It includes the value of goods and services produced, as well as any income received from foreign investments and assets owned abroad.
- Example: If a Japanese company produces goods in the United States, the value of those goods will be included in Japan's GNP.

## Harrod-Domar model
- Definition: An economic model that shows how savings and investment levels affect a country's economic growth rate.
- Explanation: The Harrod-Domar model suggests that the rate of economic growth in a country is directly proportional to the amount of capital investment required to support that growth. The model assumes that there is a fixed relationship between the amount of capital investment and the increase in production that results from that investment.
- Example: A country that invests heavily in infrastructure and manufacturing facilities can expect to experience higher economic growth rates than a country that does not.

## Hedging
- Definition: A financial strategy used by investors to reduce the risk of losing money on an investment.
- Explanation: Hedging involves taking a position in an asset or investment that is negatively correlated with another investment in order to minimize potential losses. This allows investors to limit their exposure to market volatility and uncertainty.
- Example: An investor who owns a large amount of stock in a company might buy put options that give them the right to sell the stock at a predetermined price if the stock's value drops significantly.

## Heterogeneous goods
- Definition: Goods that are not identical to one another, either in terms of quality or other attributes.
- Explanation: Heterogeneous goods are products that are differentiated from one another based on factors such as brand name, features, or quality. They are typically sold at different prices depending on these differences.
- Example: Cars are an example of heterogeneous goods, as they come in different makes and models with varying features and prices.

## Horizontal integration
- Definition: A business strategy where a company acquires or merges with other firms at the same level of the supply chain or in the same industry.
- Explanation: Horizontal integration involves a company expanding its operations by acquiring or merging with other firms that operate at the same level of the supply chain or in the same industry. This can result in cost savings, increased efficiency, and larger market share.
- Example: When Facebook acquired Instagram, it was an example of horizontal integration because both companies operate in the social media industry.

## Human capital
- Definition: The knowledge, skills, abilities, and other intangible assets that contribute to an individual's productivity and economic value.
- Explanation: Human capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and expertise that individuals possess, as well as their capacity for innovation and creativity. This concept recognizes that people are more than just labor inputs and that investing in education and training can have a significant impact on economic growth and development.
- Example: An employee who has a high level of training and experience in a particular field is considered to have high human capital.

## Human development
- Definition: The process of expanding people's freedom and opportunities to live happy, healthy, and fulfilling lives.
- Explanation: Human development is a multidimensional concept that encompasses economic, social, and cultural dimensions. It focuses on expanding people's capabilities and opportunities so that they can lead fulfilling lives and reach their full potential. This includes improving access to education, healthcare, and basic needs like food and shelter.
- Example: A government that invests in social programs like education, healthcare, and affordable housing is promoting human development among its citizens.

## Human Development Index (HDI)
- Definition: An index that measures a country's overall achievement in three dimensions of human development: health, education, and standard of living.
- Explanation: HDI is a composite statistical tool that provides a single number between 0 and 1 to rank countries based on their development progress. It was developed by Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen in 1990 and is used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to determine a country's level of "human development."
- Example: Norway has the highest HDI score of 0.957, while Niger has the lowest HDI score of 0.394.

## Hyperinflation
- Definition: A situation where there is an extremely high and rapid increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy.
- Explanation: Hyperinflation occurs when the supply of money exceeds the demand for it, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. This can lead to a loss of confidence in the currency, as people may start to seek alternative currencies or goods to store value. 
- Example: Zimbabwe experienced hyperinflation in the late 2000s, with inflation rates reaching over 79.6 billion percent in November 2008.

## Implicit cost
- Definition: The opportunity cost of using a resource that is already owned by the firm and could be put to alternative use.
- Explanation: Implicit costs are not monetary expenses, but rather the forgone benefits of using a resource in one way instead of another. They are often referred to as "hidden" or "implied" costs because they are not recorded as a transaction in accounting records. 
- Example: A business owner who uses their own car for deliveries instead of hiring a courier service incurs implicit costs by sacrificing the opportunity to use their car for personal reasons or rent it out to someone else.

## Imports
- Definition: Goods and services produced in one country and purchased by consumers in another country.
- Explanation: Imports are a component of international trade and allow countries to obtain goods and services they cannot produce domestically or acquire them at a lower cost from other countries. Importing can also stimulate domestic competition and offer greater product variety for consumers.
- Example: The United States imports automobiles from Japan, crude oil from Saudi Arabia, and smartphones from China.

## Income effect
- Definition: The change in quantity demanded of a good or service resulting from a change in consumer purchasing power due to a change in income.
- Explanation: The income effect is related to the idea that as consumers' incomes increase, they can afford to buy more of certain goods or services, which leads to a shift in their demand curve. The income effect can be positive or negative depending on whether the good is normal or inferior.
- Example: As a person's income increases, they may choose to purchase a higher quality brand of clothing rather than cheaper alternatives.

## Income elasticity of demand (YED)
- Definition: A measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in income levels.
- Explanation: YED shows how much the quantity of a good or service demanded changes in response to changes in income. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. 
- Example: If a 10% increase in income results in a 15% increase in the quantity of cell phones demanded, the YED would be 1.5.

## Income inequality
- Definition: The unequal distribution of income among individuals or households within an economy.
- Explanation: Income inequality refers to the disparities in income levels and living standards between different groups in a society. It is often measured through the Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). 
- Example: In the United States, the top 1% of earners hold more wealth than the bottom 90%.

## Income statement
- Definition: A financial statement that shows a company's revenues, expenses, and net income or loss over a specific period of time.
- Explanation: The income statement provides valuable information about a company's profitability, showing whether the company is generating enough revenue to cover its expenses and make a profit. 
- Example: An example of an income statement might show that a company had $1,000,000 in revenues, $800,000 in expenses, and a net income of $200,000 for the year.

## Indifference curve
- Definition: A graphical representation of the different combinations of two goods that provide a consumer with equal levels of satisfaction or utility.
- Explanation: Indifference curves help economists understand how consumers make choices between different goods based on their preferences and budget constraints. 
- Example: An indifference curve might show that a consumer would be equally satisfied with a combination of 5 units of good A and 10 units of good B as they would be with 7 units of good A and 7 units of good B.

## Indifference map
- Definition: A collection of indifference curves that represent a consumer's preferences for various combinations of two goods.
- Explanation: An indifference map is used by economists to represent all possible combinations of two goods that a consumer would find equally satisfying. 
- Example: An indifference map might show several indifference curves representing different levels of satisfaction for combinations of good A and good B.

## Infant industry argument
- Definition: An economic policy argument in support of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition during their early stages of development.
- Explanation: The infant industry argument suggests that tariffs and other protectionist measures can help nascent industries compete with established foreign rivals until they are mature enough to compete on their own. 
- Example: A government might use the infant industry argument to justify imposing tariffs on foreign steel imports to protect a fledgling domestic steel industry.

## Inferior good
- Definition: A type of good for which demand decreases when income increases.
- Explanation: Inferior goods are typically lower-quality or less-desirable goods that consumers buy because they cannot afford more expensive alternatives. 
- Example: An example of an inferior good might be generic store-brand food products or off-brand clothing that people may choose to buy when they have less money.

## Inflation
- Definition: A persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time.
- Explanation: Inflation means that it costs more to purchase the same goods and services than it did previously due to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. 
- Example: If an apple costs $1 today but costs $1.10 next year, there has been inflation, and your dollar can purchase less than it could before.

## Inflation premium
- Definition: The additional return that investors require to compensate for expected inflation.
- Explanation: Investors are compensated for expected inflation by earning an inflation premium on top of the nominal interest rate on an investment. 
- Example: If the nominal interest rate on a bond is 3% and the expected inflation rate is 2%, then the inflation premium for that bond would be 2%.

## Inflation rate
- Definition: The percentage change in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a specific period of time.
- Explanation: The inflation rate measures the rate at which prices are rising in an economy and is often used as an indicator of the health of the economy. 
- Example: If the inflation rate in an economy is 2% per year, it means that the general price level of goods and services is increasing by 2% each year.

## Inflation targeting
- Definition: A monetary policy strategy adopted by central banks to maintain a specific inflation rate within a target range.
- Explanation: Inflation targeting involves setting a clear and publicly announced inflation target and using various tools such as interest rates, money supply, and exchange rates to achieve it.
- Example: The Federal Reserve in the United States has an inflation target of 2%.

## Infrastructure
- Definition: The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.
- Explanation: Infrastructure includes things like roads, bridges, airports, water supply systems, communication networks, and public transportation that enable economic activity and social interaction.
- Example: Building a new highway to connect two major cities is an example of infrastructure development.

## Input-output analysis
- Definition: A method used to model the interdependence between different sectors of an economy.
- Explanation: Input-output analysis shows how changes in one sector of the economy can affect other sectors through the goods and services they produce and consume.
- Example: An input-output table for the agricultural sector might show how much fertilizer, machinery, and labor are required to produce a certain amount of output, and where that output goes as inputs for other sectors.

## Interest
- Definition: The cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage of the borrowed amount.
- Explanation: When someone borrows money, they must pay back not only the principal amount but also the interest charged by the lender. Interest represents the compensation paid to the lender for taking on the risk of lending money.
- Example: If you borrow $1,000 at a 5% annual interest rate, you will owe $1,050 at the end of the year.

## Interest rate
- Definition: The percentage rate at which interest is charged on loans or investments.
- Explanation: Interest rates are set by central banks or market forces and can have a significant impact on economic activity, particularly on borrowing, saving, and investment decisions.
- Example: The Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate in the United States is currently set at a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.

## Intermediate good
- Definition: A good or service used as an input in the production of another good or service.
- Explanation: Intermediate goods are not sold directly to consumers but rather used by businesses as part of their production process to create final goods and services.
- Example: Steel used to manufacture automobiles is an intermediate good.

## International trade
- Definition: The exchange of goods and services between countries.
- Explanation: International trade allows countries to specialize in producing what they do best and exchange those goods and services with others who specialize in something else.
- Example: China exports electronic goods to the United States and imports agricultural products from the United States.

## Investment
- Definition: The purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used to create future wealth.
- Explanation: Investing involves sacrificing current consumption in order to generate a return in the form of capital gains, dividends, or interest income.
- Example: Buying stocks, real estate, or investing in a startup company are all examples of investment activities.

## Isoquant
- Definition: An isoquant is a curve that represents all the possible combinations of two inputs (such as labor and capital) that can produce a certain level of output.
- Explanation: Isoquants are used in production theory to understand the relationship between inputs and outputs. They help to identify how changes in input quantities affect output levels, and how firms can find the most efficient combination of inputs to produce a desired level of output.
- Example: Suppose a company wants to produce 100 units of a certain product. The isoquant curve for this level of output would show all the possible combinations of labor and capital that could produce 100 units of the product.

## Keynesian economics
- Definition: Keynesian economics is an economic theory that advocates for government intervention in the economy to stabilize business cycles, increase employment, and promote economic growth.
- Explanation: According to Keynesian economics, government spending and taxation policies can help to stimulate demand during times of recession by increasing public spending or cutting taxes to increase disposable income. This increased demand can then lead to increased employment and eventually economic growth.
- Example: During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many governments around the world adopted Keynesian economic policies to try to stimulate their economies and reduce unemployment.

## Kinked demand curve
- Definition: A kinked demand curve is a model of oligopoly behavior where one firm's price cuts are matched by competitors, but price increases are not followed by competitors.
- Explanation: The kinked demand curve theory suggests that if a firm raises its prices, its competitors will not follow suit, leading to a significant decrease in demand for the firm's products. On the other hand, if a firm lowers its prices, competitors will match the price cut, so there is no gain in market share. This leads to a situation where the firm faces a "kink" in the demand curve, creating a range of prices where demand is inelastic.
- Example: The airline industry is often used as an example of an oligopoly market with a kinked demand curve.

## Labour
- Definition: Labor refers to the work done by individuals to produce goods and services.
- Explanation: In economics, labor is considered one of the factors of production, along with land and capital. The quality and quantity of labor available in an economy can have a significant impact on its ability to produce goods and services.
- Example: An automobile manufacturer employs thousands of workers who assemble cars on an assembly line.

## Laffer curve
- Definition: The Laffer curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between tax rates and government revenue.
- Explanation: The curve shows that at low tax rates, increasing tax rates will increase government revenue. However, as tax rates continue to increase, a point is reached where further tax rate increases will actually decrease government revenue because they discourage economic activity and investment. At this point, the optimal tax rate has been exceeded.
- Example: The Laffer curve was popularized during the Reagan administration in the United States as a justification for reducing tax rates.

## Laissez-faire
- Definition: Laissez-faire is an economic system in which markets operate freely without government intervention.
- Explanation: In a laissez-faire economy, the government does not regulate markets, set prices, or interfere with the decisions of private businesses. Instead, markets are left to operate according to the forces of supply and demand.
- Example: During the 19th century, laissez-faire economics became popular in Europe and the United States, with advocates arguing that it would promote economic growth and individual freedom.

## Land
- Definition: Land refers to the natural resources used in the production of goods and services, including forests, mineral deposits, and agricultural land.
- Explanation: In economics, land is considered one of the factors of production, along with labor and capital. The availability and quality of land can have a significant impact on an economy's ability to produce goods and services.
- Example: A farmer uses land to grow crops that are sold to consumers.

## Law of demand
- Definition: The law of demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, ceteris paribus (all other things being equal).
- Explanation: The law of demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics, and it helps to explain why demand curves slope downwards. As the price of a good goes up, fewer people are willing or able to buy it, resulting in a decrease in the quantity demanded.
- Example: If the price of gasoline were to increase, we would expect people to drive less, carpool more, and switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles, reducing the quantity demanded of gasoline.

## Law of diminishing marginal returns
- Defination: A law stating that as additional units of a variable input are added to a fixed input while holding all other inputs constant, the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease. 
- Explanation: The law of diminishing marginal returns suggests that as more and more resources are applied to production, the marginal return on each additional unit of resource will eventually decline.
- Example: In agriculture, if too much fertilizer is added to a field, the yield per additional unit of fertilizer will eventually decrease.

## Law of one price
- Defination: A principle stating that identical goods in different locations must have the same price when expressed in a common currency, taking into account transportation costs and other factors that affect the cost of moving the goods between locations.
- Explanation: The law of one price helps ensure that prices for identical goods are consistent across different geographic locations after accounting for any costs associated with transporting those goods.
- Example: If an apple costs $1 in New York City and $2 in Los Angeles, then someone could buy the apples in NYC, transport them to LA, and sell them for a profit until the price in both cities becomes equal (minus any transportation costs).

## Law of supply
- Defination: A basic principle of economics that states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of that good or service supplied will increase, and vice versa.
- Explanation: The law of supply suggests that suppliers will be willing to produce and offer more of a good at higher prices because the increased revenue from selling more units can offset the increased production costs.
- Example: If the price of oranges doubles, orange farmers may choose to plant more orange trees to capitalize on the higher prices and earn more revenue.

## Leakages
- Defination: Withdrawals from the circular flow of income in an economy that occur when individuals, firms, or governments save money, pay taxes, or import goods and services.
- Explanation: Leakages represent the amount of money that is taken out of the economy and not spent on consumption or investment by households, businesses, or the government.
- Example: If a household saves $100 instead of spending it on goods and services, that $100 is considered a leakage from the circular flow of income.

## Leontief paradox
- Defination: A phenomenon where a country with a lower capital-to-labor ratio exports goods that are more capital-intensive than those it imports.
- Explanation: The Leontief paradox contradicts the traditional theory of international trade that countries export goods that use more abundant factors of production and import goods that use scarce factors of production.
- Example: The United States has a high capital-to-labor ratio but exports goods that are relatively less capital-intensive, such as agricultural products, while importing goods that are more capital-intensive, such as computer equipment.

## Liquidity
- Defination: The degree to which an asset can be easily bought or sold in the market without affecting its price.
- Explanation: Liquidity describes how quickly an asset can be converted into cash without impacting the asset's value.
- Example: Cash is considered the most liquid asset because it can be used immediately for transactions without needing to be converted into another form of currency or asset.

## Long run
- Defination: A period of time in which all inputs are variable, meaning that a firm can adjust the quantities of all its inputs, including physical capital, labor, and other resources.
- Explanation: The long run is a theoretical period of time in which a firm can fully adjust its production processes and expand or contract operations as necessary.
- Example: If a company wants to build a new factory or hire more employees, these changes can only be made in the long run because there are no fixed inputs that cannot be adjusted.

## Long run average cost
- Defination: The average cost per unit of output when a firm is producing at its optimal scale, where all inputs are variable and the firm is producing at the lowest possible average cost.
- Explanation: The long run average cost curve illustrates the minimum average cost of producing each level of output in the long run, considering all possible combinations of inputs.
- Example: A factory that produces cars may find that it has an optimal level of production where it can produce cars at the lowest possible average cost per unit, which would be reflected on the long run average cost curve.

## Lorenz curve
- Definition: A graphical representation of income or wealth distribution in an economy.
- Explanation: The Lorenz curve plots the cumulative share of income received by different segments of the population against the cumulative share of the population. It helps to measure income inequality in an economy and is often used to compare the distribution of income across countries or over time.
- Example: If the Lorenz curve is a straight line, it means that income is equally distributed among all members of the population.

## Macroeconomics
- Definition: The branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole.
- Explanation: Macroeconomics deals with issues such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and government policies that affect the overall functioning of the economy.
- Example: Macroeconomics can help us understand how changes in interest rates or tax policy impact the overall level of economic activity in a country.

## Macroeconomic equilibrium
- Definition: A state where the aggregate demand for goods and services is equal to the aggregate supply.
- Explanation: In macroeconomic equilibrium, there is no tendency for inflation or recession because the economy is producing at its potential output level.
- Example: If the government injects more money into the economy through fiscal policy, it may shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, causing an increase in both output and prices.

## Marginal analysis
- Definition: The process of examining the consequences of a small change in an economic decision.
- Explanation: Marginal analysis involves comparing the benefits and costs of a decision at the margin, which is the point where one more unit of a good or service is consumed or produced.
- Example: A company might use marginal analysis to determine whether it should produce an additional unit of a product based on its marginal revenue and marginal cost.

## Marginal cost
- Definition: The additional cost of producing one more unit of a good or service.
- Explanation: Marginal cost measures the change in total cost that occurs when the quantity produced increases by one unit. It helps firms determine the optimal level of production based on their profit maximization goal.
- Example: If a company produces 100 units of a good at a total cost of $1,000 and 101 units at a total cost of $1,020, the marginal cost of producing the 101st unit is $20 ($1,020-$1,000).

## Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
- Definition: The proportion of an additional unit of income that is spent on consumption.
- Explanation: MPC measures the change in consumer spending for each additional dollar of disposable income. It is an important concept in Keynesian economics because it determines the multiplier effect of government spending or tax cuts on aggregate demand.
- Example: If an individual's MPC is 0.8 and they receive an extra $100 in disposable income, they will spend $80 and save the remaining $20.

## Marginal propensity to save (MPS)
- Definition: The proportion of an additional unit of income that is saved instead of being spent on consumption.
- Explanation: MPS measures the change in saving for each additional dollar of disposable income. It is complementary to MPC because MPC + MPS = 1.
- Example: If an individual's MPS is 0.2 and they receive an extra $100 in disposable income, they will save $20 and spend the remaining $80.

## Marginal rate of substitution 
- Definition: The amount of one good that a consumer is willing to give up to obtain an additional unit of another good while keeping the same level of utility.
- Explanation: It measures the willingness of a consumer to trade one good for another at the margin, i.e., holding constant the total utility obtained from consuming both goods.
- Example: A consumer who is indifferent between consuming 3 units of good A and 4 units of good B has a marginal rate of substitution of 4/3, i.e., she is willing to give up 4/3 units of B to obtain an additional unit of A.

## Marginal revenue
- Definition: The additional revenue obtained from selling one more unit of a good or service.
- Explanation: It represents the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity sold. It is equal to the price of the last unit sold only under certain conditions (e.g., perfect competition with no change in market price).
- Example: If a firm sells 100 units of a product at $10 each and then sells 101 units at $9.50 each, its marginal revenue from the 101st unit is $9.50 - $10 = -$0.50.

## Market basket 
- Definition: A hypothetical set of goods and services that a consumer would purchase to achieve a given level of satisfaction or utility.
- Explanation: It is used in economics as a reference point for measuring changes in the level of prices or consumer preferences over time.
- Example: An economist may construct a market basket consisting of 10 units of food, 5 units of clothing, and 2 units of transportation, and track how the cost of purchasing this basket changes over time.

## Market clearing price
- Definition: The price at which the quantity demanded of a good or service equals the quantity supplied, resulting in no excess supply or demand.
- Explanation: It represents the equilibrium price in a market where buyers and sellers freely interact and compete based on their own self-interests.
- Example: In a perfectly competitive market, the market clearing price of a good is determined solely by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.

## Market demand 
- Definition: The total quantity of a good or service that all consumers in a market are willing and able to buy at different prices.
- Explanation: It reflects the aggregate behavior of individual consumers' demand curves in a given market, taking into account factors such as income, preferences, and expectations.
- Example: The market demand for smartphones may increase if the price of substitutes (e.g., laptops) rise, or if consumers' incomes increase.

## Market failure 
- Definition: A situation where the market fails to allocate resources efficiently or fail to provide desirable outcomes for society.
- Explanation: It can occur due to various reasons such as externalities, public goods, asymmetric information, or monopoly power, leading to market inefficiency or social welfare loss.
- Example: Air pollution caused by industrial activities is an example of an externality that may lead to market failure, as it imposes negative costs on society that are not reflected in market prices.

## Market power
- Definition: The ability of a firm or group of firms to influence market price and output through their control over the supply of goods or services.
- Explanation: It can arise due to factors such as barriers to entry, economies of scale, or product differentiation, giving firms market leverage to charge higher prices or limit output.
- Example: A monopolist in a market with no close substitutes for its products has significant market power, enabling it to charge high prices and earn large profits.

## Market structure 
- Definition: The characteristics of a market that affect the behavior of buyers and sellers, including the number and size of firms, the level of competition, and the degree of product differentiation.
- Explanation: It determines the incentives and constraints faced by firms in a given market, influencing their pricing, production, and innovation decisions.
- Example: The smartphone industry exhibits a high degree of product differentiation, with several large firms competing on features, quality, and brand reputation, indicating an oligopolistic market structure.

## Market supply
- Definition: The total quantity of a good or service that all producers in a market are willing and able to supply at different prices.
- Explanation: Market supply is influenced by factors such as production costs, technology, government policies, and competition. As the price of a good or service increases, producers are incentivized to increase their supply to meet the demand.
- Example: If the price of gasoline rises, oil companies may increase their production to take advantage of the higher profits.

## Marshall-Lerner condition
- Definition: A condition stating that a country's currency will only depreciate (i.e., become less valuable) if the sum of its export and import elasticities is greater than one.
- Explanation: The Marshall-Lerner condition is used to evaluate the effectiveness of devaluation or depreciation of a country's currency on trade balance. If a country's export and import goods are both price elastic, a decrease in the value of its currency will make its exports cheaper and imports more expensive, resulting in an improvement of the trade balance.
- Example: If a country's export and import elasticities are both 0.5, the Marshall-Lerner condition is not met, and a depreciation of its currency would worsen the trade balance.

## Median voter theorem
- Definition: A theorem that states that in a two-candidate election with a single issue, the candidate whose position is closest to the median voter will win.
- Explanation: According to the median voter theorem, candidates in a political race will generally adopt more moderate positions in order to appeal to the largest number of voters whose preferences are distributed along a bell curve. The candidate who best aligns with the middle voter's preferences will have an advantage in winning the election.
- Example: In a U.S. presidential election, candidates may shift their stances to appeal to undecided or swing voters in the political center.

## Menu costs
- Definition: The cost to firms of changing prices.
- Explanation: Menu costs refer to the expenses associated with adjusting a company's prices, including printing new menus, updating websites, negotiating with suppliers, training staff, and advertising. These costs can discourage businesses from frequently changing their prices in response to changes in demand or input costs.
- Example: A pizza restaurant may face menu costs when it decides to raise its prices due to increased cheese costs. The restaurant must print new menus, update online ordering systems, and notify customers of the change.

## Merit good
- Definition: A good or service that is considered socially desirable and is often under-consumed in a free market economy.
- Explanation: Merit goods are products that provide benefits to society beyond those experienced by the consumer who purchases them. Examples include education, healthcare, and public transportation. Due to externalities, individuals may not consume enough of these goods, even though they are beneficial to society as a whole.
- Example: Governments may subsidize education or healthcare services to ensure that these merit goods are available to all citizens, regardless of their ability to pay.

## Microeconomics
- Definition: The branch of economics that studies the behavior of individual consumers, firms, and industries and how they interact in markets.
- Explanation: Microeconomics focuses on the decisions made by economic actors such as households and firms based on their preferences, constraints, and incentives. It investigates how markets allocate resources and how government policies can affect market outcomes.
- Example: Microeconomics might examine how a firm decides to set its prices, how a consumer chooses between competing products, or how a minimum wage law affects employment in a particular industry.

## Mixed economy
- Definition: An economic system that combines elements of both capitalism and socialism.
- Explanation: In a mixed economy, some goods and services are provided by the private sector through markets, while others are provided by the government or non-profit organizations. The relative mix of market-based and government-directed activities can vary widely across countries and over time.
- Example: The United States has a mixed economy, where private firms produce most goods and services, but the government also provides certain goods like roads, schools, and defense.

## Monetary policy
- Definition: The use of central bank tools and techniques to influence the supply of money and credit in the economy.
- Explanation: Monetary policy is aimed at achieving macroeconomic goals such as low inflation, high employment, and economic growth. Central banks can use policy tools such as interest rate changes, open market operations, and reserve requirements to influence the amount of money and credit available in the economy.
- Example: The U.S. Federal Reserve may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending during a recession, or raise rates to cool off an overheating economy and prevent inflation.

## Money supply
- Definition: The total amount of money available in an economy, including physical currency and bank deposits.
- Explanation: Money supply is a key tool used by central banks to regulate the economy. It has a direct impact on inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.
- Example: If the central bank increases the money supply, it can lower interest rates and encourage borrowing and spending.

## Monopolistic competition
- Definition: A market structure in which many firms sell similar but not identical products, and each firm has some degree of market power.
- Explanation: In monopolistic competition, firms compete for customers based on product differentiation, advertising, and other strategies. Each firm has some control over the price of its product, but faces competition from other firms offering similar products.
- Example: Fast food chains are an example of monopolistic competition - there are many different chains that offer similar types of food, but each chain tries to differentiate itself through branding, menu items, and promotions.

## Monopoly
- Definition: A market structure in which a single firm dominates the market and has no close substitutes for its product.
- Explanation: In a monopoly, the firm has significant market power and can charge higher prices than it would be able to in a more competitive market. Monopolies may arise due to barriers to entry or other factors that limit competition.
- Example: Examples of monopolies include utility companies that have exclusive rights to provide services in a certain area, or companies with patented products that have no close substitutes.

## Monopsony
- Definition: A market structure in which a single buyer dominates the market and has significant bargaining power.
- Explanation: In a monopsony, the buyer can negotiate lower prices for goods or labor than it would be able to in a more competitive market. Monopsonies may arise when there are high transaction costs or other barriers to entry that limit the number of buyers in the market.
- Example: A company that employs a large portion of the labor force in a small town could be a monopsony in the local labor market.

## Moral hazard
- Definition: A situation where one party takes risks because they know another party will bear the costs if things go wrong.
- Explanation: Moral hazard can arise when there is asymmetric information between parties - for example, when an insurance company cannot observe all of the actions of a policyholder. Knowing that the insurer will cover any losses, the policyholder may take risks that they wouldn't otherwise take.
- Example: Someone who buys car insurance may drive more recklessly, knowing that the insurance company will pay for any accidents that occur.

## Multinational corporation (MNC)
- Definition: A business that operates in multiple countries or has subsidiaries or affiliates in multiple countries.
- Explanation: Multinational corporations may be headquartered in one country but have operations around the world. They may face unique challenges related to managing operations in different countries with different legal systems, cultural norms, and economic conditions.
- Example: Coca-Cola, Nike, and McDonald's are examples of multinational corporations.

## Multiplier effect
- Definition: The idea that an initial change in spending can lead to a larger overall impact on the economy.
- Explanation: The multiplier effect occurs because increased spending leads to increased income for those who receive the spending, who in turn may spend more themselves. This creates a ripple effect throughout the economy, resulting in a larger overall impact than the initial spending would suggest.
- Example: If the government invests in infrastructure projects, such as building new roads and bridges, this can create jobs and stimulate spending in the short term. Over time, increased economic activity may result in further job creation and increased tax revenue.

## Nash equilibrium
- Definition: A situation in which every player in a game chooses their optimal strategy given the strategies chosen by all other players.
- Explanation: Nash equilibrium is a key concept in game theory, which studies how people make decisions in strategic situations. In a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to change their strategy unilaterally, since doing so would make them worse off.
- Example: The classic example of a Nash equilibrium is the prisoner's dilemma, where two suspects are being questioned separately and must decide whether to confess or stay silent. If both confess, they both receive a harsher sentence; if both stay silent, they both receive a lighter sentence; if one confesses and the other stays silent, the confessor receives a lighter sentence while the other receives a harsher sentence. The Nash equilibrium occurs when both confess, even though both would be better off if they both stayed silent.

## National debt
- Definition: The total amount of money that a country owes to its creditors, including individuals, companies or other countries.
- Explanation: It's the cumulative sum of all outstanding borrowings by the government over time. 
- Example: The United States national debt was over $28 trillion as of February 2021.

## National income
- Definition: The total income earned by a country's citizens and businesses, including wages, profits, and investments.
- Explanation: It measures the economic performance of a nation and is usually expressed in Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
- Example: The United States had a national income of approximately $21.5 trillion in 2020.

## Natural monopoly
- Definition: A type of market structure where a single firm can produce goods or services at a lower cost than any potential competitor.
- Explanation: This can occur when there are significant economies of scale or high barriers to entry, making it difficult for new firms to enter the market and compete effectively.
- Example: Utilities such as electricity and water supply are often considered natural monopolies.

## Natural rate of unemployment
- Definition: The level of unemployment that exists when the economy is operating at full capacity and there is no cyclical unemployment.
- Explanation: It represents the minimum level of unemployment an economy can sustain without causing inflation to rise.
- Example: The natural rate of unemployment in the United States is estimated to be around 4% to 5%.

## Natural resources
- Definition: Raw materials, energy sources, and other assets that occur naturally in the environment and can be used for economic purposes.
- Explanation: These resources may be non-renewable, such as minerals and fossil fuels, or renewable, such as timber and wind power.
- Example: Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of non-renewable natural resources.

## Negative externality
- Definition: An unintended cost imposed on a third party as a result of an economic activity, without compensation.
- Explanation: A negative externality can arise from pollution, noise, traffic congestion, or other harmful effects on the environment or public health.
- Example: Air pollution from car exhausts causes respiratory problems for people living near busy roads, which is a negative externality.

## Net exports
- Definition: The value of a country's exports minus the value of its imports over a given period.
- Explanation: It measures the net flow of goods and services between countries and is a component of a country's balance of payments.
- Example: If a country exports $200 billion worth of goods and services and imports $150 billion worth of goods and services in a year, its net exports would be $50 billion.

## Net national product
- Definition: The total value of goods and services produced by a country's citizens and businesses, minus depreciation.
- Explanation: It takes into account the wear and tear on capital stock and infrastructure over time, giving a more accurate picture of economic output than gross national product (GNP).
- Example: If a country has a GNP of $10 trillion and $2 trillion worth of depreciation, its net national product would be $8 trillion.

## Nominal GDP
- Definition: The total value of goods and services produced in an economy, calculated at current market prices. 
- Explanation: Nominal GDP includes the effects of changes in both prices and production levels from year to year.
- Example: If the production of goods and services in a country increased from $100 billion to $110 billion, but the overall price level also increased by 5%, then the nominal GDP would be $115.5 billion.

## Nominal Interest Rate
- Definition: The interest rate specified in a loan contract, without adjusting for inflation.
- Explanation: Nominal interest rates are typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR) and do not account for the effects of inflation on the purchasing power of the borrowed money.
- Example: A bank offers a personal loan with a 6% nominal interest rate. If inflation during the loan period averages 2%, the real interest rate (adjusted for inflation) would be 4%.

## Nominal Wage
- Definition: The wage rate paid to an employee, before adjusting for inflation or taxes.
- Explanation: Nominal wages represent the dollar amount paid to workers for their labor, without considering any changes in purchasing power over time.
- Example: An employee earns a nominal wage of $20 per hour. Over time, if inflation increases the price level by 3%, the real wage (adjusted for inflation) would be $19.40 per hour.

## Non-price Competition
- Definition: Strategies used by firms to compete based on factors other than price, such as product quality, customer service, or marketing.
- Explanation: In non-price competition, firms try to differentiate themselves from competitors through unique features or benefits, rather than lowering prices.
- Example: Two restaurants in the same neighborhood compete on the basis of non-price factors such as ambiance, menu selection, customer service, and reputation.

## Normal Good
- Definition: A good for which demand increases as consumers' incomes rise, holding all other factors constant.
- Explanation: Normal goods are typically associated with higher-quality products or luxury items that people tend to consume more of as they become wealthier.
- Example: As people's incomes increase, they might choose to purchase more expensive clothing brands, organic food, or premium travel experiences.

## Normal Profit
- Definition: The minimum level of profit needed for a firm to stay in business, equal to the opportunity cost of the resources used in production.
- Explanation: Normal profit is the return required to compensate entrepreneurs for their time and capital investments, without earning additional economic profits.
- Example: A small business owner calculates that she needs to generate $100,000 in revenue to cover her costs and earn a normal profit of $10,000, which represents her time and effort as an entrepreneur.

## Oligopoly
- Definition: A market structure characterized by a small number of large firms that dominate the industry.
- Explanation: In an oligopoly, firms often compete on the basis of non-price factors, such as branding, advertising, and innovation, due to their market power and influence.
- Example: The U.S. airline industry is dominated by a few large carriers, such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, who set prices and control access to key airport hubs.

## Oligopsony
- Definition: A market structure characterized by a small number of large buyers that dominate the industry.
- Explanation: In an oligopsony, the limited number of buyers gives them significant bargaining power over suppliers of inputs or raw materials.
- Example: The global coffee market is controlled by a handful of large companies, such as Nestle, JAB Holdings, and Starbucks, that purchase coffee beans from small farmers and cooperatives in developing countries.

## Opportunity Benefit
- Definition: The gain or profit that an individual or organization can achieve by choosing one option over another.
- Explanation: Opportunity benefit is the potential gain that a person or organization can obtain when they choose to pursue one alternative instead of another. It is the difference between the expected benefits of the chosen opportunity and those of the next best alternative.
- Example: If a company decides to invest in new technology, the opportunity benefit may include increased efficiency, improved productivity, and reduced costs.

## Opportunity Cost
- Definition: The cost of choosing one option over another, including both the explicit and implicit costs.
- Explanation: Opportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that must be given up when an individual or organization chooses one option over another. It includes both the direct monetary costs and the indirect costs, such as time, effort, and resources.
- Example: If a person decides to go back to school, the opportunity cost may include the lost income from not working during that time, as well as the tuition and other expenses associated with attending school.

## Output Gap
- Definition: The difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output.
- Explanation: Output gap is a measure of the difference between the actual level of economic output and what the economy could produce if all resources were fully employed. It is an indicator of the health of an economy and can be used to assess whether or not there is excess capacity or inflationary pressure.
- Example: If an economy is producing less than its potential output, it may have high levels of unemployment and underutilized resources, while an economy that is producing more than its potential output may experience upward pressure on prices and wages.

## Pareto Efficiency
- Definition: A state of resource allocation in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.
- Explanation: Pareto efficiency is a concept in economics that describes a situation where resources are allocated in such a way that no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. In other words, Pareto efficiency is achieved when no further gains can be made through reallocation of resources.
- Example: If a city has a limited budget for road repairs and must choose between fixing a major highway or several smaller streets, achieving Pareto efficiency would mean selecting the option that provides the greatest overall benefit to the community.

## Pareto Improvement
- Definition: A change in resource allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making anyone else worse off.
- Explanation: Pareto improvement refers to a change in resource allocation that benefits at least one person without harming anyone else. It represents an improvement in efficiency because it creates a net gain in welfare.
- Example: If a company introduces a new product that generates additional revenue without increasing costs, it is a Pareto improvement because it benefits the company without causing any harm to its customers or employees.

## Perfect Competition
- Definition: A market structure in which there are many buyers and sellers who are each too small to affect the market price.
- Explanation: Perfect competition is a theoretical market structure in which there are many small buyers and sellers who have perfect information about the market and are able to freely enter or exit the market. No single buyer or seller has sufficient market power to influence the market price.
- Example: The agricultural industry is often cited as an example of perfect competition, as there are many small farmers who sell their products in markets with low barriers to entry and exit.

## Perfect Information
- Definition: A situation in which all participants in a market have access to complete and accurate information.
- Explanation: Perfect information is a theoretical concept in economics that assumes all market participants have access to complete and accurate information about the market, including prices, quality, and availability of goods and services. It allows buyers and sellers to make informed decisions and eliminates information asymmetry.
- Example: The stock market is an example of a market that does not have perfect information, as companies may withhold information or manipulate data to create a false impression of their financial health.

## Phillips Curve
- Definition: A graphical representation of the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation.
- Explanation: The Phillips Curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between unemployment and inflation. It suggests that as unemployment falls, inflation rises and vice versa. The curve is typically downward sloping, indicating that policymakers face a trade-off between the two variables.
- Example: If an economy experiences a period of high unemployment, policymakers may choose to implement expansionary monetary or fiscal policies to increase spending and stimulate job growth. However, this may also lead to higher inflation over the long term.

## Pigouvian tax
- Definition: A tax designed to correct a negative externality by making the party responsible for the external cost bear the full social cost.
- Explanation: A Pigouvian tax is an economic policy that seeks to reduce the negative effects of goods or activities that impose costs on society. By levying a tax, the government aims to discourage these negative activities and encourage more positive ones.
- Example: An example of a Pigouvian tax is a tax on carbon emissions, which is meant to discourage activities that create greenhouse gases.

## Positive externality
- Definition: A benefit that accrues to a third party as a result of an economic transaction between two other parties.
- Explanation: A positive externality occurs when a person or group benefits from the actions of others or from the production of a good or service without paying for it or contributing to its production.
- Example: An example of a positive externality is a vaccination program. When one person gets vaccinated against a disease, they not only protect themselves but also help to protect others who come into contact with them.

## Potential output
- Definition: The maximum amount of output an economy can produce over a given period of time using all available resources and technology.
- Explanation: Potential output represents the highest level of economic production that could be sustained in the long run without causing inflation. It is influenced by factors such as population growth, technological progress, and capital accumulation.
- Example: If an economy is producing at less than its potential output, there may be unused resources and labor that could be put to work to increase production.

## Poverty line
- Definition: A threshold used to measure poverty in a particular country, based on the income or consumption levels required to meet basic needs.
- Explanation: The poverty line is a standard used to determine whether an individual or household is living in poverty. It is often calculated as a percentage of the median income or consumption of a country.
- Example: In the United States, the poverty line for a family of four in 2021 was $26,500 per year.

## Present value
- Definition: The current value of a future sum of money, taking into account the time value of money and the expected rate of return.
- Explanation: Present value is a financial concept used to determine the value today of a future cash flow. It is calculated by discounting the future cash flow by a certain rate of return to adjust for the fact that money received in the future is worth less than money received today.
- Example: If someone expects to receive $10,000 in five years and the expected rate of return is 5%, the present value of the $10,000 is $7,835.

## Price ceiling
- Definition: A legal limit on the price at which a good or service can be sold.
- Explanation: A price ceiling is a government-imposed limit on how much a product or service can be sold for. It is usually intended to protect consumers from high prices, but can lead to shortages and reduced quality.
- Example: Rent control is a common example of a price ceiling, where a landlord is prohibited from charging more than a certain amount for rent.

## Price discrimination
- Definition: The practice of charging different prices to different customers for the same product or service.
- Explanation: Price discrimination involves charging different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay or other characteristics. It allows firms to capture more revenue from customers who are willing to pay more while still selling to those who are less willing to pay.
- Example: Airlines often engage in price discrimination by offering discounts to travelers who book well in advance or stay over a weekend, while charging higher prices to business travelers who book at the last minute.

## Price elasticity of demand (PED)
- Definition: A measure of the responsiveness of demand for a product or service to changes in its price.
- Explanation: Price elasticity of demand measures how sensitive the quantity demanded of a product or service is to changes in its price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
- Example: If a 10% increase in the price of a product leads to a 5% decrease in the quantity demanded, the price elasticity of demand is -0.5.

## Price floor
- Definition: A government-imposed minimum price that is set above the equilibrium price in a market.
- Explanation: The purpose of such a policy is to ensure that producers receive a higher income from their sales, but it can lead to surpluses, reduced efficiency, and deadweight loss.
- Example: Minimum wage laws are a common example of a price floor.

## Price index 
- Definition: A statistical measure that tracks the changes in the average price of a basket of goods and services over time.
- Explanation: Price indices are used to assess inflation rates, cost-of-living adjustments, and economic performance.
- Example: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a commonly used price index that measures the average change in prices over time for a representative set of consumer goods and services.

## Price level 
- Definition: The overall level of prices in an economy at a specific point in time.
- Explanation: The price level is affected by various factors such as inflation, supply and demand, and monetary policy.
- Example: If the price level is high, it means that goods and services are expensive relative to a baseline.

## Price mechanism 
- Definition: The way in which prices are determined in a free market economy through the interactions of buyers and sellers.
- Explanation: Prices act as signals that convey information about the scarcity of resources, the willingness to pay, and the costs of production.
- Example: When the demand for a good or service increases, the price tends to rise, which then incentivizes suppliers to produce more.

## Price taker 
- Definition: A buyer or seller who has no power to influence the price of a good or service and must accept the prevailing market price.
- Explanation: Price takers operate in markets where there is perfect competition and many buyers and sellers.
- Example: A fruit seller at a local farmers' market is a price taker because they have no control over the market price of their produce.

## Principal-agent problem 
- Definition: A situation where one party (the principal) hires another party (the agent) to perform a task on their behalf, but the agent has different incentives and may not act in the principal's best interests.
- Explanation: The principal-agent problem is prevalent in many types of relationships, such as employer-employee, shareholder-management, and government-bureaucracy.
- Example: A company CEO may hire a manager to run a division, but the manager may prioritize their own career advancement over the company's long-term success.

## Privatization
- Definition: The transfer of ownership and control of a public enterprise or asset to private ownership.
- Explanation: Privatization is often pursued as a way to improve efficiency, reduce government debt, and promote competition.
- Example: The privatization of state-run industries such as telecommunications, airlines, and utilities has been a common trend in many countries over the past few decades.

## Producer equilibrium 
- Definition: A situation in which a producer maximizes their profits by producing at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- Explanation: Producer equilibrium occurs when a producer is operating in a perfectly competitive market and has no market power.
- Example: A wheat farmer will aim to produce the quantity of wheat that maximizes their profits, given the current market price and their production costs.

## Producer Price Index (PPI)
- Definition: The PPI is a measure of the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output over time.
- Explanation: It tracks the selling prices that producers receive for goods and services at all stages of production, including raw materials and finished products. It is used to help understand inflation and economic growth.
- Example: If the PPI for a particular industry increases, it suggests that the cost of producing goods has increased, which may lead to higher consumer prices in the future.

## Producer Surplus
- Definition: Producer surplus is the difference between the price a producer receives for a good or service and the minimum amount they would be willing to accept for it.
- Explanation: It represents the benefit that producers receive from participating in a market and is calculated as the area above the supply curve and below the market price.
- Example: If a producer sells a product for $10 but would have been willing to sell it for $8, their producer surplus would be $2 per unit sold.

## Product Differentiation
- Definition: Product differentiation refers to the process of distinguishing a product or service from others in the marketplace.
- Explanation: It involves creating unique features or benefits that appeal to specific customer segments and can help companies charge higher prices and gain a competitive advantage.
- Example: Apple differentiates its iPhones from competitors by emphasizing design, user experience, and integration with other Apple products.

## Product Life Cycle
- Definition: The product life cycle is a model that describes the stages a product goes through from its inception to its eventual decline and removal from the market.
- Explanation: The stages are typically introduction, growth, maturity, and decline, and each stage presents unique challenges and opportunities for marketers and businesses.
- Example: The iPod had a successful introduction and growth phase, but eventually declined in popularity as smartphones with music capabilities became more prevalent.

## Product Market
- Definition: A product market is a group of consumers who share similar needs or preferences for a particular type of good or service.
- Explanation: Marketers use product markets to identify target audiences and develop marketing strategies to meet their needs and wants.
- Example: The market for luxury watches includes consumers who value quality, craftsmanship, and prestige in their timepieces.

## Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)
- Definition: The PPF is a graph that shows the maximum combination of two goods that an economy can produce given its available resources and technology.
- Explanation: It demonstrates the concept of opportunity cost and illustrates the trade-offs that exist when allocating resources between two different goods or services.
- Example: A country can choose to produce either guns or butter, but the more guns it produces, the fewer resources it has available to produce butter.

## Productivity
- Definition: Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of production, often expressed as the ratio of output to input.
- Explanation: It reflects how much output is generated per unit of input, and can be improved through better use of resources, technologies, and processes.
- Example: A factory that produces 1,000 widgets a day using 10 employees is more productive than one that produces only 500 widgets with the same number of employees.

## Profit
- Definition: Profit is the difference between total revenue and total costs incurred by a business in the production and sale of goods or services.
- Explanation: It is a measure of financial performance and indicates the extent to which a company is generating income from its operations.
- Example: If a company has $100,000 in revenue and $80,000 in costs, its profit would be $20,000.

## Profit maximization
- Definition: A business objective to maximize its profit by choosing a production level where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- Explanation: Profit maximization is considered the most efficient way for firms to allocate resources and achieve economic efficiency.
- Example: A company may reduce its costs or increase its prices to maximize its profits.

## Progressive tax
- Definition: A tax system in which tax rates increase as income increases.
- Explanation: The goal of a progressive tax is to reduce income inequality by taxing wealthier individuals at a higher rate.
- Example: The US federal income tax system is an example of a progressive tax.

## Proportional tax
- Definition: A tax system in which everyone pays the same percentage of their income, regardless of how much they earn.
- Explanation: A proportional tax is also known as a flat tax because the tax rate is flat across all income levels.
- Example: Some countries have a proportional tax on consumption, such as a value-added tax (VAT).

## Public choice theory
- Definition: An economic theory that applies the principles of economics to political decision-making.
- Explanation: Public choice theory assumes that politicians and bureaucrats are self-interested and will behave in ways that maximize their own interests rather than the public interest.
- Example: Public choice theory can explain why politicians may be reluctant to implement policies that might be unpopular with their constituents.

## Public debt
- Definition: The total amount of money owed by a government to its creditors.
- Explanation: Governments can borrow money by issuing bonds to finance expenditures like infrastructure projects, military spending, or social programs.
- Example: The US national debt is over $29 trillion as of March 2023.

## Public good
- Definition: A good or service that is non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that it is available to everyone and one person's use does not diminish its availability to others.
- Explanation: Public goods are typically provided by the government because they would not be adequately supplied by the private sector due to market failures.
- Example: National defense is an example of a public good.

## Purchasing power parity (PPP)
- Definition: A theory that suggests exchange rates should adjust so that identical goods in different countries have the same purchasing power.
- Explanation: PPP takes into account differences in the cost of living between countries and attempts to measure real output and income across different countries.
- Example: If a Big Mac costs $5 in the US and £3.50 in the UK, then according to PPP, the exchange rate should be $1.43 per pound.

## Quantity theory of money
- Definition: A theory that suggests that changes in the money supply affect the price level in the economy.
- Explanation: According to the quantity theory of money, if the money supply increases faster than the growth of real output, inflation will occur.
- Example: If the central bank increases the money supply by 10%, and the velocity of money and real output remain constant, then the price level should increase by 10%.

## Quasi-public good
- Definition: A type of good that has characteristics of both public and private goods.
- Explanation: Quasi-public goods are non-excludable like public goods, but rivalrous in consumption like private goods. They are partially provided by the government and partially through markets.
- Example: Roads, bridges, and public parks.

## Quota
- Definition: A legal limit on the amount or value of a particular good that can be imported or exported during a specific time period.
- Explanation: Quotas are used to restrict the quantity of goods traded between countries, often for protectionist purposes.
- Example: The United States sets quotas on the number of cars that can be imported from Japan each year.

## Quota rent
- Definition: The difference between the price paid by domestic consumers and the price received by foreign producers when a quota is imposed on imports.
- Explanation: Quota rent is the additional profit earned by foreign producers due to the restriction on imports. It represents the loss to domestic consumers.
- Example: If a country imposes a quota on steel imports, the price of steel may increase domestically, while foreign producers earn higher profits due to the reduced competition.

## Rational choice
- Definition: A decision-making process in which individuals make choices based on their preferences and the available information.
- Explanation: Rational choice theory assumes that individuals are rational and will choose the option that maximizes their utility or satisfaction.
- Example: When deciding whether to purchase a car or take public transportation, an individual will weigh the costs and benefits of each option before making a decision.

## Rational expectations
- Definition: A theory that suggests that individuals make decisions based on their expectations of future events or economic conditions.
- Explanation: Rational expectations assume that individuals have access to all relevant information and use it to make accurate predictions about the future.
- Example: When making an investment decision, an individual may use their knowledge of current market conditions to predict the future performance of a particular stock.

## Real GDP
- Definition: A measure of the total output of goods and services produced within an economy, adjusted for inflation.
- Explanation: Real GDP takes into account changes in prices over time, allowing for a more accurate comparison of economic output between different periods.
- Example: If a country's nominal GDP increases by 4%, but inflation is also 4%, then the real GDP remains unchanged.

## Real interest rate
- Definition: The nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation.
- Explanation: The real interest rate reflects the true cost of borrowing or the true return on savings, taking into account the impact of inflation.
- Example: If the nominal interest rate is 5% and the inflation rate is 2%, then the real interest rate is 3%.

## Real wage
- Definition: The nominal wage adjusted for inflation.
- Explanation: The real wage measures the purchasing power of wages, taking into account changes in the price level over time.
- Example: If a worker earns a nominal wage of $20 per hour and inflation is 3%, then their real wage is $19.42 per hour.

## Recession
- Definition: A significant decline in economic activity that lasts for several months or years, characterized by a contraction in GDP, employment, and trade.
- Explanation: During a recession, businesses experience declining profits, unemployment rates rise, consumer spending decreases, and the overall level of economic output declines. 
- Example: The Great Recession of 2008-2009 was triggered by a financial crisis in the housing market, causing a widespread downturn across many industries.

## Reciprocal trade agreement
- Definition: A trade agreement between two or more countries that reduces or eliminates tariffs, quotas, or other barriers to trade on both sides, with each country granting similar concessions to the other(s).
- Explanation: Reciprocal trade agreements aim to increase international trade by making it easier and cheaper for countries to import and export goods and services with each other.
- Example: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is an example of a reciprocal trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

## Regressive tax
- Definition: A tax system that imposes a higher tax rate on low-income earners than on high-income earners, as a percentage of their income.
- Explanation: Regressive taxes take a larger proportion of income from people with lower incomes, which can create an inequitable burden on those who are less able to afford it.
- Example: Sales tax is a regressive tax because everyone pays the same percentage of the sale regardless of their income, so it takes a larger portion of a low-income earner's income than a high-income earner's.

## Relative poverty
- Definition: A condition in which people lack the minimum amount of income and resources compared to others in their society, resulting in a decreased standard of living.
- Explanation: Relative poverty is not based on an absolute measure of poverty but rather a comparison to the rest of society, where those at the bottom have significantly fewer resources and opportunities than their peers.
- Example: In a society where most people have access to health care, education, and adequate nutrition, those who lack these basic necessities would be considered relatively poor.

## Rent-seeking
- Definition: The use of resources to gain wealth or income through activities that do not create any new value or benefit to society, but instead exploit existing systems of power or privilege.
- Explanation: Rent-seeking behavior includes lobbying for subsidies, regulations, or other policies that benefit a specific industry or individual, without creating any real productive capacity or innovation.
- Example: A company that spends resources lobbying for government contracts or favorable regulations, rather than investing in research and development, is engaged in rent-seeking behavior.

## Reservation price
- Definition: The minimum price that a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service, or the maximum price a seller is willing to accept for a good or service.
- Explanation: Reservation price represents the point at which a transaction becomes mutually beneficial, as buyers and sellers are both satisfied with the price and value received or paid.
- Example: A buyer may set a reservation price for a car they want to purchase, based on their budget and the perceived value of the vehicle, while a seller may have a reservation price based on the costs of production and desired profit margin.

## Returns to scale
- Definition: The degree to which output increases as inputs are increased proportionally, in a production process.
- Explanation: Returns to scale can either be increasing (where doubling inputs leads to more than double the output), constant (where doubling inputs leads to double the output), or decreasing (where doubling inputs leads to less than double the output).
- Example: A factory that doubles its workforce and machinery but triples its productivity has increasing returns to scale, while a factory that doubles its workforce and machinery but only doubles its productivity has constant returns to scale.

## Risk aversion
- Definition: The tendency of individuals or investors to prefer a certain outcome over a risky outcome, even if the expected return from the risky option is higher.
- Explanation: Risk aversion arises when people fear potential losses more than they value potential gains, leading them to choose the safer option even if it may result in lower returns over time.
- Example: An investor who chooses to invest in low-risk bonds with a guaranteed return of 3% per year, instead of high-risk stocks with a potential return of 10% per year, is exhibiting risk aversion.

## Saving function
- Definition: A mathematical relationship between national income and saving.
- Explanation: The saving function shows the proportion of national income that people save rather than spend. It can be used to analyze how changes in income or other factors affect saving.
- Example: If the saving function is 0.2Y, where Y is national income, it means that for every $1 increase in income, people will save 20 cents.

## Savings 
- Definition: Income not spent on consumption.
- Explanation: Savings are the amount of money left over after all expenses and taxes have been paid. Savings can be used for investments or kept as a reserve for future needs.
- Example: If someone earns $50,000 per year and spends $40,000 on living expenses, they have $10,000 of savings.

## Scarcity 
- Definition: Limited availability of resources compared to unlimited human wants.
- Explanation: Scarcity is a fundamental economic problem that arises due to the imbalance between the limited supply of resources and unlimited human wants. It forces people to make choices about how to allocate resources efficiently.
- Example: Water is a scarce resource in many parts of the world, so people must use it wisely and conserve it.

## Seasonal unemployment 
- Definition: Unemployment caused by seasonal fluctuations in demand for labor.
- Explanation: Seasonal unemployment occurs when businesses experience fluctuations in demand for labor due to seasonal changes in production or consumer demand. Workers may be laid off during slow periods and rehired when demand picks up again.
- Example: A ski resort may lay off workers during the summer months when there are fewer visitors and rehire them during the winter ski season.

## Shadow price 
- Definition: Opportunity cost of using a resource or good.
- Explanation: The shadow price is the value of a resource or good in terms of its opportunity cost. It reflects the cost of using a resource or good for one purpose instead of another.
- Example: The shadow price of using land for agriculture instead of housing is the potential rental income that could be earned if the land were used for housing.

## Short run
- Definition: Time period in which some inputs are fixed.
- Explanation: The short run is a period of time in which some inputs in the production process are fixed, such as plant and equipment. In the short run, firms can adjust their output by varying the use of variable inputs, such as labor and raw materials.
- Example: A restaurant may be able to hire more waitstaff to handle increased demand for meals, but cannot expand its kitchen or seating area in the short run.

## Short run average cost 
- Definition: Average cost of producing a unit of output in the short run.
- Explanation: Short run average cost is the sum of all the variable and fixed costs associated with producing a given level of output divided by the number of units produced. It reflects the cost of producing each unit of output in the short run.
- Example: A company's short-run average cost of producing 100 units of a product might be $10 per unit, while the cost of producing 200 units might be $8 per unit.

## Shortage 
- Definition: Situation where demand exceeds supply at a given price.
- Explanation: A shortage occurs when the quantity demanded of a good or service exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price. This can lead to higher prices and rationing of the good or service.
- Example: During a gasoline shortage, consumers may have to wait in long lines or pay higher prices to fill up their tanks.

## Shutdown point
- Definition: The minimum price point at which a firm can cover its variable costs and stay in business temporarily.
- Explanation: It is the point at which a firm has to decide whether to continue operating or shut down when it cannot cover its fixed costs.
- Example: A manufacturing firm that cannot sell enough products to cover its fixed costs may have to shut down operations temporarily.

## Social benefit 
- Definition: The positive effects of an economic activity on society as a whole.
- Explanation: It is the overall benefit that society derives from a particular economic activity, such as the production of goods or services.
- Example: Building a new hospital in an area with inadequate healthcare facilities would provide social benefits through improved access to medical care.

## Social cost 
- Definition: The negative effects of an economic activity on society as a whole.
- Explanation: It refers to the overall cost incurred by society as a result of a particular economic activity, such as pollution, congestion or other externalities.
- Example: A factory that pollutes nearby water sources would impose social costs on the community through contaminated water supply and health problems.

## Social optimum 
- Definition: The point where social welfare is maximized.
- Explanation: It is the level of output at which social benefits equal social costs, resulting in maximum social welfare.
- Example: A government policy to regulate industrial emissions may aim to achieve the social optimum by balancing the social costs of pollution against the social benefits of industrial production.

## Social welfare
- Definition: The overall well-being of society as a whole.
- Explanation: It reflects the degree to which society benefits from an economic activity after considering both its social costs and social benefits.
- Example: Improving education and healthcare systems can increase social welfare by improving the quality of life for individuals.

## Solow growth model 
- Definition: A neoclassical model of economic growth that examines how changes in capital stock, population, and technology affect long-term economic growth.
- Explanation: It is a framework for understanding how investment in physical or human capital and technological innovation can drive economic growth over time.
- Example: Assessing the impact of changes in population growth rates, savings rates, and technological change on economic growth rates using the Solow model.

## Specialization 
- Definition: Focusing on producing a specific good or service in which one has a comparative advantage.
- Explanation: It is the process of concentrating on a specific task or activity in order to become more efficient and productive, rather than attempting to perform all tasks oneself.
- Example: Countries often specialize in producing goods or services that they are most efficient in, allowing them to trade with other countries and maximize overall productivity.

## Speculation 
- Definition: Purchasing an asset in the hope of making a profit by selling it at a higher price in the future.
- Explanation: It is the act of taking a position in an asset with the expectation of profiting from future price movements.
- Example: Investing in cryptocurrency with the expectation of selling it at a higher price in the future, without regard to its underlying fundamentals.

## Stabilization policies
- Definition: Economic policies aimed at reducing fluctuations in economic activity, particularly at stabilizing employment and prices.
- Explanation: These policies are designed to stabilize the economy during periods of recession or inflation. They include fiscal policies (changes in government spending and taxation), monetary policies (changes in interest rates and money supply), and exchange rate policies (changes in the value of a country's currency).
- Example: The U.S. Federal Reserve uses various stabilization policies to maintain stable prices and low unemployment, such as adjusting interest rates and increasing or decreasing the money supply.

## Stagflation
- Definition: A situation where there is a combination of high inflation and stagnant economic growth.
- Explanation: It is a rare economic phenomenon where the economy experiences stagnant growth, high unemployment, and high inflation simultaneously. This can be caused by a supply shock that increases production costs and reduces output while simultaneously increasing prices.
- Example: The 1970s saw a period of stagflation in the United States due to an oil supply shock and other economic factors.

## Standard of living
- Definition: The level of wealth, comfort, material goods, and necessities available to an individual or group in a particular geographic area.
- Explanation: It is a measure of the quality of life, considering factors like income, education, healthcare, and access to basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter.
- Example: A person with a high standard of living typically has access to better housing, healthcare, education, and transportation than someone with a lower standard of living.

## Sticky prices
- Definition: Prices that do not adjust quickly to changes in supply or demand.
- Explanation: They can result in market inefficiencies and cause shortages or surpluses. One reason for sticky prices is that firms may fear losing customers if they raise prices, so they keep them artificially low.
- Example: Gasoline prices often exhibit stickiness, as they may remain relatively stable even when the cost of crude oil fluctuates significantly.

## Stock
- Definition: A type of security that represents ownership in a publicly traded company.
- Explanation: Investors purchase stocks to gain a share of the company's profits and potential appreciation in the stock price. Stocks can be bought and sold on exchanges, and their prices are determined by supply and demand.
- Example: Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are examples of companies whose stocks are traded on major stock exchanges.

## Structural adjustment program
- Definition: A set of economic policies recommended by international financial institutions to help developing countries improve their economies.
- Explanation: These programs typically involve measures like reducing government spending, privatizing state-owned enterprises, and opening up markets to foreign trade and investment. They aim to promote economic growth and stability in developing countries by encouraging market-oriented policies.
- Example: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have implemented structural adjustment programs in various countries, including in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

## Structural unemployment
- Definition: Unemployment caused by a mismatch between the skills of workers and the requirements of available jobs.
- Explanation: It occurs when workers lack the necessary skills or training to fill job openings, which can lead to long-term unemployment. Structural unemployment can also occur due to technological changes or shifts in the economy.
- Example: Workers who lost their jobs in the manufacturing industry due to automation and outsourcing may experience structural unemployment if they lack skills relevant to new job opportunities in other industries.

## Subsidy
- Definition: Financial assistance provided by governments to support certain industries, products, or activities.
- Explanation: Subsidies can take various forms, including direct payments, tax incentives, loan guarantees, and price supports. They aim to encourage economic activity in specific areas and boost industries that may otherwise struggle to survive.
- Example: The U.S. government provides subsidies to farmers to support the agricultural industry, while some European countries provide subsidies to renewable energy companies to reduce carbon emissions.

## Substitute good
- Definition: A substitute good is a product or service that can be used as an alternative to another product or service, usually because it serves the same purpose.
- Explanation: If the price of a particular product rises, consumers may choose to buy a similar product instead, which leads to an increase in demand for the substitute good.
- Example: If the price of coffee increases, some consumers may switch to tea as a substitute good.

## Substitution effect
- Definition: The substitution effect is the change in consumption patterns that occurs when the price of a good changes, assuming that the consumer's level of satisfaction or utility remains constant.
- Explanation: Consumers tend to buy more of a good when its price falls and less when its price rises. This is because they substitute it with other goods that offer similar utility.
- Example: If the price of apples decreases, a consumer might choose to buy more apples instead of oranges, assuming that both fruits offer the same level of satisfaction.

## Sunk cost
- Definition: A sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered or changed.
- Explanation: Sunk costs are irrelevant to future decision-making because they have no bearing on the expected benefits or drawbacks of a particular course of action.
- Example: If a company invests $1 million into a new project and later finds out that it is not viable, the $1 million is a sunk cost that cannot be recovered.

## Supply
- Definition: Supply refers to the amount of a product or service that producers are willing and able to sell at a given price and time.
- Explanation: Producers are influenced by factors such as the cost of production, the price of inputs, and market conditions when deciding how much to supply.
- Example: If the price of a product increases, suppliers may increase their production to take advantage of the higher profits.

## Supply curve
- Definition: The supply curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied by producers.
- Explanation: The supply curve slopes upwards to show that the quantity supplied increases as the price of the good or service increases, assuming all other factors remain constant.
- Example: A supplier may increase the quantity of a good supplied from 100 to 150 units if the price of the good increases from $10 to $15 per unit.

## Supply schedule
- Definition: The supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied by producers.
- Explanation: The supply schedule provides a numerical representation of the supply curve and shows the quantity of a good or service that will be supplied at different prices.
- Example: A supplier may be willing to supply 50 units of a good at a price of $5 per unit, 100 units at a price of $10 per unit, and 150 units at a price of $15 per unit.

## Supply shock
- Definition: A supply shock is a sudden and unexpected event that disrupts the supply of goods or services in a market.
- Explanation: Supply shocks can be caused by natural disasters, wars, government policies, or other factors that affect the production or distribution of goods and services.
- Example: An earthquake that damages factories in a region may cause a supply shock and reduce the supply of certain products.

## Supply-side policies
- Definition: Supply-side policies are economic policies aimed at increasing the productivity and efficiency of producers in order to boost economic growth and create jobs.
- Explanation: Supply-side policies can include measures such as reducing taxes, deregulation, investment in infrastructure, and education and training programs.
- Example: A government may introduce supply-side policies to encourage businesses to invest in new technology, which may lead to increased productivity and output.

## Surplus
- Definition: The amount by which the quantity supplied of a good or service exceeds the quantity demanded at a given price.
- Explanation: Surplus occurs when there is excess production of a good or service, leading to unsold inventory and lower prices. It represents inefficiency in the market as resources are not being allocated optimally.
- Example: A surplus of apples may occur if farmers produce more apples than consumers are willing to buy at a given price.

## Surplus value 
- Definition: The difference between the value created by a worker's labor and the wage they are paid by their employer.
- Explanation: Surplus value is the source of profit for capitalist enterprises, as they pay workers less than the value they create through their labor. It is the fundamental concept in Marxist economics.
- Example: If a worker produces $50 worth of goods per hour but is only paid $10 per hour, the surplus value generated by their labor is $40 per hour.

## Tariff
- Definition: A tax on imported goods, designed to make them more expensive and protect domestic producers from foreign competition.
- Explanation: Tariffs are often used as a tool of protectionism, aiming to support domestic industries and reduce imports. They can also be used to generate revenue for governments.
- Example: A country may impose a 25% tariff on imported steel to make it more expensive than domestically produced steel.

## Tax
- Definition: A compulsory financial charge imposed by a government on individuals or businesses to fund public services and programs.
- Explanation: Taxes are an important source of revenue for governments, enabling them to provide public goods and services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Different types of taxes include income tax, sales tax, property tax, and corporate tax.
- Example: An individual may pay income tax on their earnings, with the percentage rate depending on their income level.

## Terms of trade
- Definition: The ratio at which a country's exports can be exchanged for imports from another country.
- Explanation: Terms of trade reflect the relative value of a country's exports compared to its imports. Improvements in terms of trade mean a country can import more goods with a given amount of exports, while declines in terms of trade mean they have to export more to afford the same amount of imports.
- Example: If a country can export one ton of wheat in exchange for five tons of rice from another country, its terms of trade are 1:5.

## Tobin tax
- Definition: A proposed tax on financial transactions, named after economist James Tobin, intended to reduce currency speculation and stabilize financial markets.
- Explanation: The Tobin tax would impose a small fee on each transaction in currencies, stocks, and other financial instruments, discouraging short-term speculative trading and generating revenue for the government. It has been criticized for being difficult to implement and potentially damaging to market liquidity.
- Example: A Tobin tax of 0.1% on all currency transactions would add a $1 fee to every $1,000 traded.

## Total cost
- Definition: The sum of all the costs incurred by a firm in producing a certain quantity of output, including both fixed costs and variable costs.
- Explanation: Total cost provides insight into the profitability of a firm by accounting for all the expenses associated with production. Fixed costs are those that do not vary with the level of output, while variable costs increase as production increases.
- Example: A firm that produces 100 widgets incurs $10,000 in fixed costs and $20,000 in variable costs. Its total cost is $30,000.

## Total product
- Definition: The total quantity of output produced by a firm or industry using a given set of inputs.
- Explanation: Total product reflects the productivity of a firm or industry in transforming inputs (such as labor and capital) into outputs. It is typically represented graphically as a curve that starts off steeply sloping and then flattens out as diminishing returns set in.
- Example: A factory that employs 50 workers may produce 500 units of output per day. Its total product is 500 units.

## Total revenue
- Definition: The total amount of money earned by a business or organization from selling goods or services.
- Explanation: It is the sum of all the payments received in exchange for products or services provided by a company. 
- Example: If a company sells 100 units of product A at $10 each, its total revenue would be $1,000.

## Trade creation
- Definition: The increase in economic welfare resulting from the creation of new trade through specialization and comparative advantage.
- Explanation: It occurs when countries start trading with each other, allowing them to produce more efficiently and increase their overall production and consumption.
- Example: When two neighboring countries agree to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers and start trading, they can both benefit from producing and exporting goods they are most efficient at producing.

## Trade deficit
- Definition: A situation where a country's imports exceed its exports, resulting in a negative balance of trade.
- Explanation: It means that a country is spending more on foreign goods and services than it is earning through its own exports, which may lead to a decrease in the value of its currency.
- Example: If a country's imports are worth $500 billion and its exports are worth $400 billion, it has a trade deficit of $100 billion.

## Trade diversion
- Definition: A situation where the creation of a free trade agreement causes a country to switch from importing goods from a more efficient producer to a less efficient one.
- Explanation: It occurs when a country chooses to import goods from a less efficient producer within the free trade area to avoid tariffs, instead of importing from a more efficient producer outside the area that would still be subject to tariffs.
- Example: If Country A signs a free trade agreement with Country B, and stops importing goods from Country C (which is not part of the agreement) because of the tariffs imposed on those goods, then it is experiencing trade diversion.

## Trade liberalization
- Definition: The process of reducing or eliminating restrictions on trade between countries, such as tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers.
- Explanation: It aims to increase international trade by allowing more goods and services to move freely between countries, leading to increased competition, innovation, and efficiency.
- Example: When a country reduces its tariff rates on imported goods, it is engaging in trade liberalization.

## Trade protectionism
- Definition: The use of government policies and regulations to restrict or limit international trade, usually to protect domestic industries and jobs.
- Explanation: It involves measures such as tariffs, quotas, subsidies, and other trade barriers that make foreign goods more expensive or difficult to obtain, giving domestic producers an advantage.
- Example: If a country imposes high tariffs on imported automobiles to protect its domestic car industry, it is practicing trade protectionism.

## Trade surplus
- Definition: A situation where a country's exports exceed its imports, resulting in a positive balance of trade.
- Explanation: It means that a country is earning more from its exports than it is spending on foreign goods and services, which may lead to an increase in the value of its currency.
- Example: If a country's exports are worth $500 billion and its imports are worth $400 billion, it has a trade surplus of $100 billion.

## Tragedy of the commons
- Definition: A situation where individuals or groups overuse a shared resource, leading to depletion or degradation of the resource.
- Explanation: It occurs when individuals pursue their own self-interest without regard for the long-term consequences, leading to a situation where everyone suffers due to the loss of the shared resource.
- Example: Overfishing in a lake or ocean can lead to the depletion of fish populations, which could have serious consequences for the ecosystem and the livelihoods of fishermen who depend on those fish.

## Transaction costs
- Definition: The cost incurred in making an economic transaction, such as buying or selling goods/services.
- Explanation: These costs include fees, taxes, transportation, and other expenses that are associated with the exchange of goods/services.
- Example: A company incurs transaction costs when buying raw materials from a supplier, which includes shipping costs, taxes, and any other fees.

## Transfer payments 
- Definition: Payments made by the government to individuals or businesses without expecting anything in return.
- Explanation: These payments are usually welfare programs, such as unemployment benefits, social security, and subsidies to farmers.
- Example: The government provides transfer payments to unemployed workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic.

## Underemployment 
- Definition: A situation where a person works in a job that is below their skill level, education, or experience, resulting in lower pay than what they could earn.
- Explanation: This term is used to describe workers who are employed but not utilized to their full potential.
- Example: A highly skilled software engineer working as a cashier at a retail store because they cannot find a job in their field.

## Unemployment 
- Definition: A state where a person who is actively seeking employment is unable to find work.
- Explanation: It occurs when there is a mismatch between the skills of job seekers and available job openings.
- Example: An individual who just graduated from college and is looking for a job but has not found one yet.

## Unemployment rate 
- Definition: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed at a specific moment in time.
- Explanation: It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total number of people in the labor force.
- Example: If a country has an unemployment rate of 5%, it means that 5% of its eligible workforce is currently unemployed.

## Unintended consequences 
- Definition: Outcomes that were not intended or anticipated by a particular action or decision.
- Explanation: They can be either positive or negative and often arise from complex systems, policies, or interventions.
- Example: The introduction of seat belt laws resulted in a decrease in fatalities from car accidents, but also led to an increase in non-fatal injuries.

## Utility 
- Definition: A measure of satisfaction or happiness that a person derives from consuming a good or service.
- Explanation: It is a subjective concept and varies from person to person.
- Example: An individual derives utility from consuming food, entertainment, travel, or other goods/services.

## Utility function 
- Definition: A mathematical formula used to represent an individual's preferences and choices regarding the consumption of goods and services.
- Explanation: It takes into account an individual's income, price of goods, and personal tastes to determine the maximum level of utility that can be achieved.
- Example: A consumer's utility function for pizza may take into account factors such as price, taste, and convenience of purchasing, to determine how many slices of pizza they would prefer to buy at a given price.

## Utility maximization 
- Definition: The process of making decisions that maximize the satisfaction or utility a consumer derives from consuming goods or services.
- Explanation: It involves weighing the marginal utility of each additional unit of a good against its price to determine the optimal quantity to purchase.
- Example: A person who has $10 to spend on ice cream can choose between buying one expensive scoop or several cheaper scoops, depending on their individual preference for quantity versus quality.

## Value added 
- Definition: The amount by which the value of a product or service is increased at each stage of production or distribution.
- Explanation: It is calculated by subtracting the cost of inputs (such as materials and labor) from the price of the final product or service.
- Example: If a carpenter buys $50 worth of wood and spends two hours building a table that she sells for $300, the value added by her labor is $250.

## Variable costs
- Definition: Costs that vary with the level of output or production.
- Explanation: They include expenses like materials, labor, and energy that increase or decrease depending on how much the business produces.
- Example: A restaurant's variable costs might include food ingredients, staff salaries, and utilities, which all increase when more meals are served.

## Variable input
- Definition: An input to the production process that can be varied in quantity in order to alter the level of output.
- Explanation: Examples of variable inputs include labor, raw materials, and energy.
- Example: A bakery may use more flour, sugar, and eggs to produce more cakes, or hire additional bakers to work longer hours.

## Veblen good
- Definition: A product whose demand increases as its price rises, due to its perceived prestige or status symbol value.
- Explanation: This violates the law of demand, which states that as a product's price increases, demand should decrease.
- Example: Luxury goods such as high-end cars, designer clothing, and jewelry can be considered Veblen goods.

## Welfare economics
