## Introduction

Nigeria and Ghana are two neighboring countries in West Africa with different economic development trajectories.

Nigeria is a major **oil producer and exporter**, but it faces many challenges such as political instability, corruption, insecurity, environmental degradation and poverty[^3].

Ghana is a lower-middle-income country with a more diversified economy that relies on **agriculture, mining, manufacturing and services**[^1]. Ghana has also been more stable and democratic than Nigeria in recent years[^1].

## Factors

Some of the factors that affect their economic development barriers include:

- **Resource endowment:**
  - Nigeria has abundant natural resources such as **oil, gas, coal and minerals**, but it suffers from the "resource curse" phenomenon where dependence on natural resource exports leads to **poor governance**, rent-seeking behavior, conflict and underdevelopment[^4].
  - Ghana has **fewer** natural resources than Nigeria but it has managed to exploit them **more efficiently and sustainably** such as **gold, cocoa and recently oil**[^1].

- **History:**
  - Both countries were colonized by Britain until the 1960s.
  - Nigeria experienced several coups d'etat and civil wars after independence that **disrupted its political and economic development**[^3].
  - Ghana also faced some political turmoil after independence but it underwent **a successful transition to democracy** in the 1990s that **improved** its governance and institutions[^1].
- **Political systems:**
  - Nigeria is a **federal republic** with 36 states and a bicameral legislature. It has a **multi-party system** but ethnic and religious divisions often influence political alignments[^3].
  - Ghana is a **unitary republic** with 16 regions and a unicameral legislature. It has a **two-party system** that alternates power peacefully through regular elections[^1].

- **Political stability:**
  - Nigeria faces **various security threats** such as insurgency by Boko Haram in the northeast, militancy by Niger Delta Avengers in the south-south, banditry by Fulani herdsmen in the north-central and secessionist agitation by Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the southeast[^3]. These conflicts undermine public order, human rights and economic development[^3].
  - Ghana enjoys a **relatively peaceful** and secure environment that fosters social cohesion and investor confidence[^1].

- **Climate:**
  - Nigeria has a tropical climate with **two main seasons**: wet and dry. It is vulnerable to droughts, floods, desertification and erosion that **affect its agricultural productivity and food security**[^3].
  - Ghana has a tropical climate with **four main seasons**: wet and dry in the south, and harmattan (dry wind) and hot in the north. It is also exposed to climate change impacts such as rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, coastal erosion and deforestation that **threaten its natural resources and livelihoods**[^1].

- **Population:**

  | Population Statistics | Nigeria | Ghana |
  |-----------------------|---------|-------|
  | Total population (2020 estimate) | 211 million[^13] | 31 million[^14] |
  | Median age (2020 estimate) | 18.4 years[^13] | 21.5 years[^14] |
  | Fertility rate (2018 estimate) | 5.4 children per woman[^13] | 3.9 children per woman[^14] |
  | Poverty rate (2018 estimate) | 40%[^13] | 25%[^14] |
  | Literacy rate (2018 estimate) | 62%[^13] | 79%[^14] |

  - Nigeria has a population of about 211 million people (2020 estimate), making it the most populous country in Africa and the seventh in the world. It has a young and growing population with a median age of 18.4 years. It also has a high fertility rate of 5.4 children per woman (2018 estimate). Nigeria faces **challenges** such as **high unemployment, poverty, inequality, illiteracy, malnutrition and poor health outcomes among its population**[^3].
  - Ghana has a population of about 31 million people (2020 estimate), making it the 47th most populous country in the world. It has a relatively young population with a median age of 21.5 years. It also has a moderate fertility rate of 3.9 children per woman (2018 estimate). Ghana has made **progress** in **reducing poverty, improving education, health and gender indicators among its populatio**n[^1].

## Example

### Illegal Oil Refineries in Nigeria

{{< image src="illegalOilRefineries.webp" width="100%" caption="Illegal Oil Refineries in Nigeria" >}}

  - These are makeshift facilities that process **crude oil stolen from pipelines** or wells into low-quality fuel for local consumption or export.
  - They cause **environmental damage** such as oil spills, air pollution and deforestation. They also deprive the government of revenue and encourage criminal activities such as oil theft, sabotage and violence.


### Electronic Waste Landfills in Ghana

{{< image src="electronicWasteLandfills.webp" width="100%" caption="Electronic Waste Landfills in Ghana" >}}

  - These are sites where **discarded electronic devices** such as computers, phones, TVs and refrigerators are dumped or recycled.
  - They pose health risks such as exposure to **toxic chemicals, metals and radiation**. They also contribute to environmental problems such as soil contamination, water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
